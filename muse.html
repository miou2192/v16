The late, great, SUMMERWISHER: Up here in the mountain it warms your forehead and pours honey into your nose. Im taking time to go back in time. Thats what i have to do. Wearing my button down maroon. It takes a lot to go back, but not unless you are the SUMMERWISHER, WINTERDREAMER. What do i mean? What do these words mean? Is it worth it to say that this is so important, when i will never have it stick, when ill only forget? Non autonomy. Its a large quantity. Go into that confusion, go back and shut yourself up. Go back, be teenage, talk big (im sure.) Then i became self(ves). Im sure (of me?). Its not hard. Its something im wonderfing. I want to be bright enough. I want to be bright. Im really, really trying to figure it all out -- im really good at repeating myself -- its a big stream of conciousness. Get it off. And im Dovea the Dove. I want to be bright enough. Get that feeling working. Get yourself mad. And go out, and think of yoursel(ves). And meet yourself, and do what youll do. But you can still see your reflection. There it is. I want to be bright enough.<br>

I live in the city so im always seeing pigeons always seeing them walk around sometimes soar, and lately i see them in solitary flight, like maybe they had some type of conflict; usually they go in groups in swarms that people point at with disease on their finger, now i see them all alone -- maybe they listened?; theres people who doubt them thinking they listen, and when they do, nobody does notice but the skeptics, the tinheads, people waiting for something to prove it, but the pigeon is alive and understands wind under a wing, and a person can know the wind under their arm, through their fingers, dancing, the wind wants to communicate what it speaks to the bird the way it does through a human -- there is no differentiation -- but, only as we know, it is impossible.<br>
