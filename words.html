832PM/MON/552025 I cant believe i ever forgot you, website, your significance, what you do for me. Today its still rainy out and i cant believe it but the rain has me thinking about that jar again. I still cant maintain a name even after all this time because usually, you name people when theyre born, not when they die. I tried to spin it around into an object thing, that maybe you name them once theyve broken. And i like that idea, but i think i settled on Bob. Did i? Bob. Or Gregory, for the jar, but i cant remember. But again, anything can be different, so maybe his name is Bob and Gregory. When he broke around 2 years ago i planned on a funeral. If you were there for that, hello, but im sorry, i havent been able to do it yet. Most of the grief is gone, it doesnt really hurt as much anymore. Just a big bummer. But this rain has me thinking about it again, and im going to put his shards out on the windowsill. I think its torture making his shards sit on this desk feet away from the endless storm outside. Hold on a minute. 836PM. The three shards are out there. Im glad i came up with that idea. I get a certain feeling in the rain, and feel free to start listening if it interests you; most people feel that need to keep dry. I do it too. I dont know where it comes from. We all want to be very dry. Angry at our lizard fish counterparts. But recently i find it if you go out and break past that first dry wanting, you can be wet outside and enjoy it. When its humid and smells good, and youve already sweat a little bit, you can let yourself get poured on. I hope for rain. Come see me again, rainstorm. Go get yourself soaked, people! GOOD LUCK, YOU 838PM<br><br>
1217PM/SUN/542025 The weather is absolutely incredible. Last night it rained very hard and we put the plant out on the fire escape. Its just drizzling a little. Im sitting at a bus stop because today i had an arrangement with my friend for to meet for fun at their place but, you know, directions. Ended up halfway across Brooklyn instead. But i found a bus thatll take me straight there. Some adjacent detail from two days ago that i wanted to share: when waiting at my (regular) bus stop, i had crouched onto the ground and saw a bee hovering above the pavement for a moment before deciding to land. Saw it go through a decision. There was also a kind lady there who asked me when the bus was coming. Now that its warm, the whole world is in love with itself. 1219AM<br><br>
1101PM/SAT/532025 FOR THE VERY LAST TIME, LISTENING: I am a perfectionist, a preservationist, a sensitive, an artist, a searcher, a hopes-and-dreams, an anxious, a feeling, loving, a winged, a holding, hiding, quieting, an in-between-er, an overthinker, a speaker, wanting, person. Nothing worse than that. ;-). 1103PM<br><br>
1049PM/SAT/532025 <b>Its raining.</b> When youre thinking about preservations there are two principles that are equal parts important as they are infuriating. Everything you think will be saved will be deleted, and everything you think has been deleted has been saved. There are hidden archivists everywhere you look, you only have no idea because neither do they. Anybody who cares enough will begin to preserve (either that or something drastic). In any case a preservationist is someone who tries to equate a level of logic to love, which is deeply difficult, but to some nasty, but to some interesting. To some that it is interesting it is very difficult. You need a lot to do it, and you need very little to want it. <b>Everything changes when it rains.</b> I finally came to the conclusion that i am not a spiritual person but i am a very emotional one. Sometimes being emotional gets you closer to logic, as hard as it is, and sometimes you try very hard to consolidate what should be a feeling into the ability to remember that feeling. It comes from here. <b>Right now, i am looking outside out my window out in the alley where it is very very dark and very very wet and the water is piling and its angry out there because of whatever made it that way, you know, and the bottom of the hitches are flooding and the alleys in the pavement are flooding and i am flooding because the city is me.</b> In that way, anything can preserve. You need to want. 1056PM, LOVE FOREVER<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 10px; line-height:2px;">Why I Remember Each Day of Summer by Dagmar Zuniga</p>
<br>
1226PM/WED/4302025 It is consistently warm now and in that case, expect possibly to hear from me less. I dont get bothered by natural slump or instinct. I havent created much traditional art as of this slump. But i dont get bothered by it. But possibly i may slink into unknown with the warmth. My hair is getting long. Wings feel sticky, but not in the bad way they are. Its a good consideration. It would be easier if people could see them. Additionally, an excerpt from an earlier thought (~1030AM): I have this lifelong fantasy, that i am my true self all alone wandering in the woods eating fish from rivers and molting, and then a lab comes and catches me with a big net. But im not scared, i just look at the scientists with my big curious eyes and the lab is very humane and they give me blankets and snacks and music and its so nice in my lab. Sometimes when im stressed i take comfort in the consistency of experiment schedules. And when im sad i take comfort in being studied. And when im overwhelmed i think about the day theyll release me back into the woods. End. 1230PM<br><br>
1233PM/MON/4282025 Addendum, i cannot believe i hardly mentioned the WEDDING! On boat. It was very fun. There was a lot of music and we all got to dance and it was very fun. I had a stomachache but remarkably no headache. On the water. On boat. Very fun. My first wedding. Weddings have made a good impression on me. 1234PM<br><br>
1227PM/MON/4282025 I am woefully behind on all things college. Anyway i am back home now and it is a cozy morning. Eating a toasted corn muffin. Florida was wonderful but it is a relief for the air to no longer be so cumbersome. And there i met my good friend Aurora down there. And it was so wonderful. So very wonderful. Everything tends to come together like that. Last day of my two week break. Tomorrow i head back to school. I have a lot of missing assignments that piled up over the week i was gone while others were at school. I am trying my best to not worry about it because good news: the vine outside has leaves again. Theyve grown! Everything is very green. Being plucked up into the sky by a plane is nowhere near close to flight, but close enough. I am hoping everyone everywhere does well. Trying not to worry about it. 1232PM<br><br>
510PM/THU/4242025 What are conversations supposed to be about? Whats are words or letters? 511PM<br><br>
310PM/THU/4242025 Hello again, since forever. Ive been bad at reporting lately. Im sorry. Yesterday we touched down in Florida. My impressions: the air smells good. It smells sweet. Or New York City stinks. Also, trees are very different. Noticeably there are so many different birds. A few: blue jay, cranes, and many mourning doves to my delight. Its hot but i havent sweat through any shirts yet. I feel like i hardly will because of the good winds. Its supposed to be 80 degrees. Maybe its 80 degrees directly under the sun. In the shade with wind its a cool New Yorkly spring day. Im trying really hard right now to not freak out. Theres a pool at the house we have and i swam about pretending im Mr. Pihrana today. In my clothes. I will never wear a bathing suit. Tomorrow is the day of the wedding. What fun... what fun... what... Went to Publix last night. Ohh boy. Ohh boy. Ohh boy. I have been recording everything. Everything. AAnd im very scared. But i am excited because Florida. Not so bad. Why does every kid here have so many keychains on their backpacks? Its Florida. Im toasty. AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wedding. 316PM<br><br>
1000AM/MON/4212025 Its been a while since a solid scoop for you. Today is MONDAY, APRIL 21ST. Today we go down to the TAILOR to get the sleeves on my suit shortened. I have my shoes, my shirt, my pants, my jacket. Yesterday was Easter. Im sorry i did not call. I went to my Aunts for the day and sat around doing mostly nothing. But nothing with family which is different. The weather was incredible yesterday. On today is also LAUNDRY, which is as much of a burden as it is a gift. On today is also MOMS PEDICURE, MANICURE. In 2 days we fly South. Ive prepped gift baggles for this summers OSC event too. And they are wonderful. I am supposed to be getting ready to head out, but i am sitting here writing to you, eating Nilla wafers. GOOD LUCK, YOU 1005AM<br><br>
156AM/SUN/4202025 In tandem: "The balance of colors and shapes is YOU", at last, "It's perfectly reasonable to get stuck on 'Everything's a miracle' for a couple of decades". Grandmother. Love Grandmother. 157AM<br><br>
154AM/SUN/4202025 <b>What are you supposed to do about that?</b> 155AM<br><br>
1146PM/WED/4162025 Mental vaccination. I can feel it prick, prick, prick the arm. Sometimes i just hold on tight and never let go. 1147PM<br><br>
623PM/WED/4162025 Written on the ride home. Got a suit. Right leg pounding at the wet cement left leg barely there and a chickpeap hounding my ear. Today is a day i am very still. Its a good day that doesnt make me happy. It just exists around me as good. You cant stop yourself from feeling anything even alongside a good day that remains still. Alex G in my left ear, might as well. Right leg still pounding. Today, in the taxi, i stared out the window with my head caressed by the seat. It was a nice posture to be seated at so there were the clouds above me, just ahead of the river that was heading in the same direction i was. Immediately considered moms scream for 60 seconds. When i came out of it (that fog), i noticed i was still staring at the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful clouds. Trees are blooming again along the river. I didnt know that was possible. 631PM<br><br>
1027PM/TUE/4152025 I wonder what it feels like for you to read what i write without ever knowing what it said before you began to read it unlike myself? 1028PM<br><br>
1024AM/SUN/4132025 Happy Breaktime! I realized just now that i should update you on the amazing things that happened yesterday at the shopping day, ive just woken up. Went out for clothes with mom. For the wedding later this month. Went to look for a suit. None were thin enough for how the weather will be down in Tampa, but i tried them all on, looking in the mirror like a MAN. And laughter. My mom and i we discussed my name, she still feels very very bismirched. She could consider the existence i live is not the same person as her baby on September 16th, 2008. She wont, of course, because i love her. And suits. I bought 3 boy boy belts, and 1 cute cute shirt. Did not find the appropriate suitage. Later. She did not find a dress. Before all of this -- sorry for hiding it from you -- we bundled over to the market for food and i was stopped -- literally -- in my tracks by a vintage place for MOVIES, MUSIC, FILMS, and TOYS. All old items, all surrounding me at all angles. Of course i was allowed to get distracted. I bought four 45 inch records (DEVO, Elton John and Kiki Dee, two others i cant remember) and three cassettes (Supertramp Paris, a handmade cassette written in spanish, and most interestingly, a handmade cassette written "Big Band Hits, for Ritz") and i got home and absolutely died -- the poetic music listeners are correct in the way they talk about record player music. I curled up at the floor by the record player and listened to Slip Away by Bob Gaudio and Judy Parket and died, directly on the floor. And as close as possible, to music. To music. 1033AM<br><br>
139PM/FRI/4112025 How amazingly easy it is for people to affect people, how radical it must be to be purposefully alone in a way that does not allow for anything like this. How saddening, at the very least, for me, it is very, saddening to think of. Why is this a consistency? Its very swirly without words to come poke the swirl. Everyone WILL be changing you very very soon and its near impossible to let this not happen to you, everything is going to make you change and want to be like other people. Every envy. Every envy will happen. You can read things and maybe get scared of them. Or maybe feel something, maybe try to be more like that. Maybe be more like this. Maybe yourself is invented. Thats kind of what ive been thinking is that yourself is an invented belief. All youve got to do left is whatever your whims are leading you to do -- listen now because its very prime here: Whatever you want to do is what youll do. There is no oblique or original, there is no natural, normal, slate. You are the slate, you do what you are going to do, you do it at your whims. There is nothing to stop you to control you or to let it all go. You do what you are going to do, you do it at your whims. GOOD LUCK, YOU 145PM<br><br>
828AM/FRI/4112025 Missed school again yesterday. This week ive only been to school Monday, Wednesday, and today, Friday. Im still kind of sick but its less miserable. Anyway, continuing to work on a New Thing, somehow i am actually DOING it, for the very first time. AMAZING! Amazing, i kno! The laziness boy has done his thing right. I am ahead! Also i have no school all of next week, wonderful. Wonderfing. Here we go... all is awful and all is wonderful. However there are no extremes. 830AM<br><br>
820PM/WED/492025 Tenements Of It: Everything Is Animals, Forever. You Can Do Anything You Want To Do, Forever. Everything Works, Forever. I Love You, Forever. Thank You, Forever. You Can Do Things You Want Forever. Everything Is Worth It, Forever. Have Fun For Free. Do It For Fun And For Free. Do It Up. For Fun. Forever. 822PM<br><br>
933AM/WED/492025 I am sick still. Everyone at school is sick too. Its still biting windy. I am very emotionally ungood at the moment its all very distracting and im putting myself into a project that is actually already happening, i am very excited, but i have so many words theyre all around and, i just kind of want to talk. But i hate hearing it now. I hate it. IM SOUR. SOUR! Good luck, dont catch a chill. 935AM<br><br>
846AM/MON/472025 Rainy biting windy cold today. Made it on time. Reading The Taking of Pelham One Two Three at last. Nothing is embarrassing after you read a book. Nothing. My head hurts so much. 847AM<br><br>
444PM/SUN/462025 Im just doing what i can. Im just doing the most that i can. Im doing it. All of it. How important is it? My head hurts. 445PM<br><br>
<audio controls src="https://file.garden/Zs7cg0vKj2GBOghZ/strawberryfieldsforever.mp3" loop></audio>
<p style="font-size: 10px; line-height:2px;">Strawberry Fields Forever by The Beatles</p>
<br>
1049PM/SAT/452025 Yes. How important is it? 1050PM<br><br>
1245PM/FRI/442025 HOT and HUMID outside. For once enjoying feeling sweat. I have never enjoyed it before. My face keeps feeling warm and heated from my shirt, but i am enjoying it, like i am being gently cooked and tossed by the sun and WARMTH. HOT outside. Its real hot. The ground is wet. 1247PM<br><br>
157PM/THU/432025 Its almost like the weather cant decide if it wants it to be rainy today. Instead of getting greasy my hair has been getting exceptionally soft like a greasy pigeon. Pretty headfeathers. Pretty pretty. Ugh. A dream. I had a dream. 159PM<br><br>
1018AM/THU/432025 I am finally ready to speak big and speak much, even though things are still things in the way they are. Just so confusing. Up is very down, right couldnt be any more left. Heres an idea: there are a lot of ideas and truths about the world that are phrased as BAD things which makes them even harder to accept. The idea that nobody will care about you more than they care about themself is a harder truth that is a hidden gift. Who would spend the time? The idea that a conversation is a TRICK is a gift. The idea that the world is one big transactional TRICK, oh its good. Its good, and it cant be explained as good. Im running around and my hat fell off and im hurrying hurrywise from whack a mole to whack a mole. And when one principle stays down the rest pop up like "HELLO, fuck YOU, did you forget about me? Im sure i was forgotten about? No, here i am again. Im going to fuck you over." Thats basically what happens. It sucks, words have terrible sad associations. Average Joe reading this thinks its a pessimistic drone. This is the most me i am and not pessimism or negativity, only what i see and what i believe and what i figure. What i figure: its true, but packaged in little razors and needles. Just handle it and cut it open like you would a coconut. Then drink. In addition: i learnt that when i was born, i didnt cry. I just looked around, curious as if i knew. "Whats all this?" 1024AM<br><br>
1054AM/WED/422025 On the way home from school yesterday i saw a pink glove and the crust of a watermelon slice laying apart on either side of the sidewalk, glove left, melon right. On the way to school this morning i saw them again but this time, the glove was on the right side of me and the watermelon was on the left side of me. I still feel awful -- i dont really know what im supposed to do about it. It sounds endlessly teenage to claim you are incapable of doing anything, but thats sure as hell how it feels. I am failing very very excellently. I dont seem to know what most people do. Now, im questioning conversation again. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football">If only i were a space probe</a>. Then it might be easier. 1059AM<br><br>
841AM/TUE/412025 April Fool! Nauseous. IDK. 16 years and 200 days, on the April Fool. 844AM<br><br>
1115AM/MON/3312025 Woke up nauseous. Mouth feels gross. I had a very long dream because i kept forcing myself back asleep. I originally woke up at 8:30 but decided it wasnt worth it. The dream started making less and less sense as i kept forcing it. But the main point, the main plot, the important part: i spoke to my old childhood friend in her old childhood room with a few other kids who i didnt know. Feelings: sad, confused, tense, distraught. Body feelings: all my limbs are going to pop off, and i am going to throw up all my organs. 1117AM<br><br>
1235AM/MON/3312025 Body feelings: heavy. Still nauseated. As i lay on my bed my mind continues to believe i am still laying in the same position on my aunts couch. I glued myself to that couch, i guess. When i close my eyes, ill pretend im there. Body feelings: gross. My tongue is big. 1237AM<br><br>
906PM/SUN/3302025 Written in my notes in the car home. The lights across the black gulf looked like they were twinkling, if only hidden and then revealed and hidden and revealed again by the sputtering branches that seperate us. The question no one ought to answer: "What do you think of yourself?" The reason being, no one ought to know. Its a good thing. No one ought to know themself. You better know what you want, but you better not go any further than that. Who knows? Here i am with every iteration. I dont really know if im being literal or metaphorical, if ever, but i wont finish my sentences, you know? May as well. Get there. May as well. I dont know if i really mean it, but it felt like my wings sloughed off. I felt it. I dont know anything, and nobody else ought to know anything, either. Metaphorically. No, literally. I cant decide. How about you? 909PM<br><br>
944AM/SUN/3302025 Today is cold again and its supposed to rain. I would like it better if it rained when it was warm. I couldve probably sat in the rain like an edgy teenager in a music video with a closeup of the water dripping off my nose and the background is extra blurred with circles of light everywhere and stuff. Anyway, my wings are exceptionally heavy today. If people who identify further with their phantom sensations can call their phantom limbs by their real names, i ought to stop calling them my back, and start calling them my wings. So theyre heavy. 948AM<br><br>
1044PM/SAT/3292025 It got cold again. Feel like throwing up. 1046PM <br><br>
358PM/SAT/3292025 First warm day. First truly warm day. The air finally smells again. I am sitting in my aunts backyard, and i was just listening, just catching the wind. Low self esteem, high hopes. 359PM<br><br>
835AM/SAT/3292025 I had a dream about being suspected for murder under intoxication, sitting in a train station, ignoring everybody, and a really good movie about time. I woke up and immediately had a charlie horse in my leg. Today me and my family are watching a movie in the morning. After that we are going down to my aunts and staying there for the weekend. I am would-be excited. Otherwise i am too distressed and distracted, and i feel like a piece of shit. Except to me it is so firm, so real... i dont know what to believe at all. At one point in the dream, while we were sitting in a classroom watching the movie, i turned around and saw a pink sticky note on the wall, and all it said was No, Nobody. Distraught. Distraught. 839AM<br><br>
1210AM/SAT/3292025 On the subway home this afternoon, <i>a ladybug landed on me</i>. Flew straight in through the train doors just as they were closing, and parked itself on my shirt. I let it crawl my hand for a while. It stayed with me for about 2 minutes before fuzzing off. A <i>ladybug landed on me</i>. Distraught. 1212AM<br><br>
210PM/FRI/3282025 Two things i forgot to mention. 1. I respond to authority with "no?" and angry looks. I was very angry at tacky authority when i was 10, maybe even earlier. It never went away. 2. The rubber on one of my earbuds fell off in the stairwell. I felt it slide off in my hand but couldnt find it in the mass of feet. I have extra at home. 211PM<br><br>
203PM/FRI/3282025 New ipad update lets me code on Safari properly without getting a huge headache and ripping the fibers out of my socks. Its awesome. I went out for lunch today and it was fine. It was great. Bought a slice of pizza and took it back to the lunchroom and ate it there. Thought: couldnt i just walk away from school and keep walking? In history class they opened up a form that let students ask any question they wanted. Mine was focused on for a good 5 minutes. Ample time. I kept it to myself. I chewed the eraser on my pencil today but gently, so that it looks like it was eroded very carefully by a river. It does look like a rock. Drew on my hand. I think i feel good, but my mind does not like that i feel good. I feel weird. Weird. Its all very weird. It is so... 207PM<br><br>
823AM/FRI/3282025 Body feelings: Warm in stomach, can feel it empty in a way. Bones very heavy. Moving in slow motion. My throat feels very open, like im gulping too much air down. Breathing manually the entire morning. Smells: One of the train stations that my train stops at seems to smell entirely like fresh magazine paper. The outside of the school was swathed in foul smelling smoke from its vent. I thought i was going to be late to school this morning, but i made it perfectly on time. ~830AM

426PM~Thu~3272025 I havent spoken loudly in a while. Heres what ive exactly done, approximately: got scared. Scary. Made art. MUSIC. Scared. Felt <i>happy</i>. Regretted it. Ruminate. Ruminated. Ruminated. Had 10 billion things to do, did them all. Still scared. I am sitting in a pizzeria and its freezing. My hands are freezing. I thought spring came for me? Spring, why? I looked to my left a minute ago and there was a man taking bottles from the garbage to sell. There is a group of teenage boys in the table ahead of me rudely discussing women. I ate two pizza slices. Im waiting here. I have a play to go see in 30 minutes. Good, goodwill, goodwill, good. I need a belt. I cannot be heard, but ill try to speak again. I have a feeling i am going to hurt myself beyond purpose. Time to go. 432PM<br><br>
919PM~Wed~3262025 AH, here comes the great relief of having done things supposed to be done at the time they were meant to be done. AH, i have a very potent feeling now. I have a very potent feeling. I love my website. I love you, collections of information, you will serve me very well. I love my repository. I love, love, my repository. I am feeling very c;-). Here it comes. Youll make it, YOU. 921PM<br><br>
531PM~Wed~3262025 <i>Music is absolutely terrifying.</i> I am so excited for SUMMER to come lift me up and toss me around like a loose duck. I am so excited to go places. I am so scared of music. 532PM<br><br>
235PM~Wed~3262025 This morning i woke up before my alarm in excruciating stomach pain. The same type of stomach pain i had the day i fainted. Yesterday i found my old keyboard sitting out in the living room when i thought we had thrown it out when i stopped using it. It was covered in dust and i said no okay, lets get you back home. Messed around on it for a while and just kind of had fun. So i didnt go to school today because of that stomach pain and its both a blessing and a curse. Lots of things to do that kind of bump into each other but its alrighty. Feel: Fine. But bad. Weird is all of it. 238PM<br><br>
806AM~Tue~3252025 Chills. Perfect. Musical chills. A GOOD DAY -- TWO DAYS. I brought pasta lunch for the first time today. GOOD LUCK, YOU 807AM<br><br>
141PM~Mon~3242025 Im tired and i want to go home. But happy. 145PM<br><br>

813AM~Mon~3242025 Its 8:13 again. Someones singing happy birthday outside class in the hall. Wow! Today its rainy again. Absolute bliss, permissive bliss. THIS BOX IS NOW. I started hyperventilating on the walk to school. Last night when i was doing the dishes i banged a bowl a little bit because it was wet and slipped in my hand and it made a loud noise and all i could think about afterward was smashing it against the counter. I wasnt angry but all i could think about was smashing it against the counter so i could make the noise again. It was not good. SILICA GEL: DO NOT EAT. In everything i am so clean! Better yet when it rains when youre so clean, better yet when its so cold. Burn in the shower, freeze outside. To eliminate bacteria. Clean clean. Made it to school on time. Theres something festering in my belly but everything around me is good. I am hungry. 818AM<br><br>
1242PM~Sun~3232025 I had a good weird powerful dream. Its hard to explain where i was but it was sort of this amalgamation of my neighborhood with lots of half dead east coast forest plants and grass and things like that. Plants if they were industrial and there was construction surrounding a giant smokestack. There was also another tall structure maybe a statue. First it was just me but then there were a lot more people and we were all around the area and i felt so so full of energy because there were so many people all together. One of them was my friend. I ran inside my apartment to get my camera and the place was all dead silent. When i went into my room it was dark and i think it was my old childhood room. I took the camera, fully charged, ran outside, and started to get pictures. Something i like to happen when im dreaming is when i wake up just a little bit, so i realize im awake, so when i go back to sleep i can focus more intently on the part of the dream i want. Thats what happened here. I got a good picture of my friend and then it was over. Im not sick anymore. My throat still smells sick but im not sick anymore. 1246PM<br><br>
740PM~Sat~3222025 Doing ok in a mean way. (Awful, horrified, but not enough for those words.) Chickpeas are chicks that go peap peap. I fell asleep instead of cleaning the stuff off of my bed like i was supposed to. I havent been able to fully lie on my bed in months. I want to go back to my grandmothers place. I have no grip strength. My body is very good at getting rid of this sickness. Chickpeap. 742PM<br><br>
915AM~Sat~3222025 I realize it might be a good idea to include the day of the week in my dates. Anyway i am still sick but after sleeping and letting my body destroy the world i feel slightly less sick. My head doesnt hurt now but i know it will later. Every movement frustrates me and makes me overwhelmed. Even blinking. When my parents talk to me i get even more overwhelmed because of being sick. The skin around my left nostril is painful and rough. I want to draw a lot but i feel so overwhelmed by all my senses from being sick. Its more likely that another student gave me a cold but its possible that it was so easy to infect me because of how ive been doing. I know mental and physical illness tend to mix all up. I want to eat lime chips so bad but if i do ill tear my throat open. I had a disturbing sick-dream that i dont want to talk about in detail. Something about the city and girls. Hiding. Criminals. And i colored a misshapen rock into the image of a moon about to be eclipsed. 920AM<br><br>
553PM~3212025 Thinking about forgiveness again. I am likely not succumbing to allergies. I am sick. I dont get sick often but when i do it really really sucks. My throat is still a little rusty and my nose is both stuffy and dripping like a faucet. When i lean down it drips instantly. Im sitting in the bathroom with the shower running hot so i can steam it up. It isnt really helping. My clothes are sticking to me. I am sick. It keeps repeating in my head. 555PM SPREADTHELOVE<br><br>
1034AM~3212025 Need to remember: its a common experience to forget yourself. Still yet nobody knows what a self is. I see really no use in looking for it. Impulsively i might go looking. Its only natural. Its an even more common experience, when you are autistic, to try very hard in childhood to formulate a version of yourself more palatable. And especially when formed so young, its hard to shake. I know there is a real me. Its hard to be honest with it. It feels shameful when it shouldnt feel shameful. Most people prefer you smile. That was what i had to learn. Need to remember: you can do whatever you want to do forever. 1036AM<br><br>
724AM~3212025 Remembered this. The phone number for AAA batteries support is 1-800-AAA-HELP. AAA, HELP! AAA, HELP! And my student metrocard isnt working anymore. 725AM<br><br>
716AM~3212025 Writing this in my notes app and transferring it later. Well Spring is here, and i havent exactly, made a good first impression. I think it was angry at me for not saying Happy Spring to everyone i met because last night it tricked me (lured me in) with real rain. I opened the window to smell it and was instantly hit with pollen. Im congested for the first time in months. Thats wild. Needless to say Spring has tricked me. I have a sore in the back of my throat because of it. Now im swallowing every 5-15 seconds to keep it wet. I dont know if that actually does anything, i just know if i dont swallow, i cant feel it there, and thats not very reassuring. Yesterday a lot of cards dropped. First my friends school ID. Theyd dropped it and didnt notice it. On the way out of school i picked another one up off the sidewalk and thats when i ran into my friend again and gave them their ID but now i had a strangers ID so i walked back to the school to put it in the hands of staff but on the way i dropped MY ID. So i picked it up and dropped the other one off and got the hell OUT of there, before anything crazier happened. Couldnt really handle that. Anyway the clouds are doing something crazy this morning. Tried to capture it, kind of failed, but tried. I still dont feel too god. I misspelled good as god. Ouch. I feel like i have perpetual vertigo. Two bats with acrylic tipped claws stomping in the desert and waking up the weevils. Napping on the train now. 722AM<br><br>
816PM~3202025 Ohgod. 816PM<br><br>
1058AM~3202025 I bit and peeled my lip so hard it bled. Now its just sore. I think all my blood is going to come out in one big burst from my back. WHY? "AUTOTHERAPY". If i say enough words, eventually, all ill have to do is quote myself whenever i want to say something. MARCH, why would you do this? 1101AM<br><br>
813AM~3202025 Same time as yesterday. We are aligned, i guess, or something, today the universe listened to me. Its drizzling. ONE MOMENT -- 815AM. Had to help a friend with a tech problem. Theyre paving the road again. New and dark and sticks out like a big welting scab. The music was so powerful i could not breathe at all, it was drizzling and i had to open my mouth and suck in the air. I was very aware of my tongue this morning, more than i usually am in the mornings. My jaw is usually like glue. And hey, i did not sleep in. I think i am going to die. Heavier. "Miph and Morret" would be a good name for a tv show about two exotic animals who sit around all day throwing meat paste at birds and trying to kill eachother. With computer mice and sheet music. 819AM<br><br>
813AM~3192025 Grapes. I dont think ill be able to eat anything. Im not scared about the test. Something doesnt sit right with me at all. Im being warned again by March. I feel nauseous. Im up in the room now. We are picking senior courses today. I looked at the salami cheese snacks i brought and gagged. Theyre delicious. I dont know whats wrong. I am being warned by the month of March. 845AM<br><br>
1114AM~3182025 I have the SAT tomorrow. The Scholastic Aptitude Test. Ive successfully convinced myself that it wont be a problem. Numbers Numbers Numbers numbers numbers numbers numbersnumbersnumbersnumbnumbnumbersersers. Now it isnt a word anymore. You see what i just did? 1116AM<br><br>
647PM~3172025 I smell like bleach. I cleaned the bathroom. Dirty dirty dirtydirt. Lifting up the mat and cleaning the tub is a visceral behavior to me which makes me feel like i am gutting an animal and then putting it back together. I have to use considerable strength to hold up the rubber while the shower beats down. The water made some really interesting shadows and i tried to get them on camera but failed. Ill put them here later if i like them maybe or even more so if i dislike them. Cleaning the tub makes me feel visceral. I noticed that. It forces me to get my hair wet. My hair is wet now. Even though my legs were weak today and hurt today and my head hurt, i think im gonna be big. And i left the window open so the bathroom can air out. It smells like bleach. I smell like bleach. I smell like a bathtub.<br>
"Where do you find this stuff?!"<br>
"It just came into... my life"<br>
"Whatd you say?"<br>
"It just came into my life." 650PM<br><br>
115PM~3172025 Nobody can really stop me from messing up: I havent been wearing my retainer and one of my teeth has shifted backward. I havent been able to brush my teeth before bed, just in the morning. Im either ravenously hungry or wont eat at all, or eating out of compulsion. I am violently non-suicidal. I am violently afraid in a new way, today, im figuring out what i am again. Again im someone different. I cant bear to get anything done, and i just nearly failed, and somehow, <i>nobody is mad at me for this.</i> I think im going to reinvent my abuse ten million times. Thats whats probably going to happen. I have missing assignments. Aplenty. Im never comfortable with my website. Never. Im comfortable with information. Nobody can really stop me from messing up. I am not ready. My <i>wings.</i> 121PM<br><br>
1108AM~3172025 While i stand firm with my "who knows" belief about the afterlife this doesnt mean i dont have hopes or desires for what could be there. It isnt really concrete. I dont think of the idea of a heaven. I think of the idea of INFORMATION. I hope there would be a way to replay everything. Find all the billion coincidences that i am never aware of. Im sure ive stood at particular coordinates where interesting things have happened before. Im feeling very "strange" "strangely normal". And im always thinking about this. And its so weird. Its so weird how much we think we are communicating though we really arent, its statistically impossible. But we get very close. All the time getting close. I hope for INFORMATION i get to replay everything. I just get to watch. My television watchingwatchwatch watching. Funnn, id hope for it to be that way. But again "who knows" really and if i never got to learn these things that would be fine. Anything could be fine. With enough time, nothing will worry anybody anymore. 1113AM <br><br>
615PM~3162025 Today is a Sunday. I am still very scared about everything but this time im very scared with a .COM domain. HOW EXCITING... i tried very hard to make an auto update thing work so that everything on .COM will mirror to .NEOCITIES.ORG immediately but i failed. I spent all afternoon trying it but nothing really seems to be working. That isnt ideal but its fine. Ill copy paste any changes i make when i make them. Anyway i have chores, and the SAT is coming up, and my <i>wings.</i> 617PM<br><br>
229AM~3162025 My thing i wrote was suddenly gone. I guess ill get to the point, since i cant really feel embarrassed anymore: you have to do it. 230AM<br><br>
302PM~3152025 And it is weird. I have never been so not-suicidal in my entire life. Maybe when i was a toddler. Its not that im happy about it. 303PM<br><br>
248PM~3152025 "I swear, theres the ME, and then theres the glass box behind me with the guy inside whos been COMMENTING my entire life. And as i get older the box has been getting farther and farther away from me." 249PM<br><br>
1241PM~3152025 And lately its felt like all my limbs are full of syrup and as the adrenaline gets worse they get more syrup-y. I have too much scared-syrup in my body. I also keep feeling like i will throw up. I wont. But it feels like it. My arm is gonna pop off and syrup is going to pour everywhere 1242PM<br><br>
1135AM~3152025 I dont like how much i really look for other people. I look for people everywhere, i look for them in the bricks, i look for them in the dirt. I look for them anywhere where people arent. And its nice. But i cant help myself from sharing things or looking to the world, though it is concretely bleak i still have sensitivity left. I guess i mean i do not like my "sensitivity". That i need other people. Which isnt a burden in and of itself but still awful when the world does not align. It wont always align. Im very scared. Ive been scared for all of March. I dont know. I dont really know anything. I mean i know things i just dont, know how to express them, which in a way, makes them not real at all. I guess what i have in my heart and head is important but not real when i cant express it. All for me again. I wish i did not need other people. I wish i were more alone sometimes. I have been scared for all of March. 1138AM<br><br>
1145PM~3142025 That is so weird. That is so very weird, right 1146PM<br><br>
1128PM~3142025 Alright ive been so uptight, like. Ive been so self aware, ever since i was alive. I was like im alive now. And now im a person. I saw other people living and making choices and every single choice i saw was stupid. So i compartmentalized it: ill be aware of myself all the time. OR I CAN JUST BE FREE and NOT do that, JESUS CHRIST, what an UPTIGHT and PAINFUL way to live. Ill be aware of myself but not monumentally in the way that means im gonna die every 2 seconds because 2 seconds ago i existed differently. IM ALWAYS GOING TO EXIST DIFFERENTLY. FUCK. Its always going to happen. You cant stop that. It wont work. So im pretty much insanely self aware and looped back to the point where it doesnt matter because im not at all aware of anything. Because right now its 11:30 at night but hey who even knows, even though im sleep deprived and feeling emotions as a result of my mind poking at my psyche like its a bear with zero enrichment ill still LET GO of BEING AWARE of myself and PUNCH the bear the way ive always supposed to. Then tomorrow ill wake up and think "wow, he is fucking insane, and just reread 17776." 1131PM<br><br>
506PM~3142025 My dad made me carrot ginger cake for lunch but i forgot to eat it. Remembered it on the way home. When i got to my building i leaned against the wall and stood there eating it outside. Warm breezes are finally coming back. Finally. When its cold wings stay in and huddled even with the breeze because its more of a chill. Not that they are real enough to conserve heat or anything. But when theres a warm breeze... i held them open in the face of it. And stood there. Ate my carrot ginger cake. Im figuring it out again. 509PM<br><br>
226PM~3142025 If i say something that doesnt make sense then consider it typical. Theres a few reasons this happens. One is that because ive learnt to trust things that will make sense to a later version of myself i dont question it. They dont make sense to me either sometimes. Other times by the time ive decided its worth it to put the idea outside it no longer makes sense. Thats normal. Of course it can just be discrepancies, but sometimes it isnt. 229PM<br><br>
101PM~3142025 "What do you think, glasses or no glasses?" "Hmm. Glasses" "I think youre biased." "True but then again if you asked someone who didnt wear glasses theyd also be biased." "Ill just ask someone whos blind." 102PM<br><br>
1125AM~3142025 I forgot how to be indifferent again. Im gonna forget everything. Yesterday i was really scared about getting alzheimers because i think itll happen to me. Like nearly certainly. Im already so loosebrained theres no way i wont be decaying in my senior years. Im excited to be old but that stumps it. My grandma on my moms side has it. My grandma on my dads side doesnt and she remembers a lot. So i could go either way. I hope im that way. In the shower last night i got soap in my mouth it dripped down to my mouth. For a second it tasted sweet and nice so i licked it more but immediately it was nasty and i cupped water in my hands to spit. But even after the bitter taste was gone the feeling of holding water in my wrinkly hands and swishing it was nice. Like i was in the woods and scrounging for any drinking water i could find. I dont know i dont know what im doing everything scares me. HEY, HERES THIS, as spring comes back expect wing talk. In the shower last night i realized i havent brought it up in a while. I suddenly got very excited about it in conjunction with the weather changing. I dont know if thats just a coincidence or if it means something but i avoid any sort of logic when it comes to wings so yes... ill say its spring that does this. Theyre heavy like ive got new feathers coming in or something. Ill remember. I felt comfort when i read my log from the other day telling me GOOD LUCK, YOU 1134AM<br><br>
947AM~3142025 Im really trying to figure it out.<br><br>
9AM~3142025 I changed my site layout drastically. Which is really horrifying. Im trying to figure out who this version is.

 <p><b>Mar 12 2025 10:03PM</b> God i must sound <i>insane</i> to people who arent me sometimes! Theres always been a layer of self awareness making me think yeah, i know my world is so confusing, but then again, i know im aware of it which must be better. Ive been trying to find where the line is. What breaches world and thoughtfulness and heads into dangerous insanity territory? I thought it was self awareness but really that cant be true i mean, you can still be completely out of your gourd and be aware the gourd has escaped you but who really knows. Im just doing everything. Everything i have to do. I thought about summer again. Its coming up on the second time ive told you about summer. You know what it is but theres something about holding onto time. Again in case you forgot, its impossible, its so impossible. Absolutely impossible. You cant hold on to time or oh my god i cant believe my phone just distracted me. Watch me decline. Watch me fall. Hold on. Look at my foot and its slipping on the edge. There it is. You cant capture a time but its even more painful when other people get involved because i cant just, spit out Summer 2024 at you, you will never know what mine was, what my world was. Neither will i. I have the haze of it. I have the haze of knowing how badly i cared about it while it was all happening, but aside from that, its never been captured before. You can take as many pictures as you want. Thatll get you closer to it. But youll never hit the mark there. Its impossible. You cant hold on to time. It wont let you. Sometimes i let myself use commas. Impossible. I just remember how i felt every day going to my ""job"" feeling like i was sweating down to everywhere surrounded with new people that for once i felt divorced and simultaneously conjoined with. I just put my music in and walked. And walked. And walked. Summer couldnt have been any different. And walked. Knew id forget it, because i did, but not really. I walked. 7/14/2024: "I have bad memory loss. So for me this is the first summer of my life. Its sad only if you think about that in a sad way, but i dont think about it in a sad way. like, i know ive had summers, but i cant look at them altogeter. this is the first time i had a summer where i acknowledged the season, so maybe itll count in my mind. Or maybe ill forget again. Who knows." GOOD LUCK, YOU <b>10:14PM</b>

You didnt need to decide how long you held on for. You just did it. Then it was over, and the sine dipped down and changed you again. This is a graph with an outlier. You have a range. I have a range, sorry. And this range goes forward or backward but it never just identifies right now it only ever identifies now as it is in reference to past or now as it is in reference to future. If i open my eyes, i can see both of them at the same time. But if i close my eyes, i dont see present. I just see either one or the other. Thats why i have two eyes, i guess. One to look forward, one to look back. Even if i open both of them, i wont see present. Thats whatever. And the thing is, 90% of the time youre never even talking to whoever youre talking to. So its okay. You can just say things, whether youre speaking to a human being or the air, and both have the same amount of meaning. Thats what it is. I recognize you. You smell like you dont understand. Because thats what it is. Thats what it is. "ATOYOT" is TOYOTA backwards. I saw it on the car window. <b>5:36PM</b>

 <p><b>Mar 8 2025 9:38AM</b> Yesterday i woke up reeling from 12 hours of sleep and the 12 year long dream i had alongside it. It was the type of dream that contained things that only became concerning after youd woken up. I went through the day awful. And my hands were very sweaty but i only noticed once i unclenched my fingers and the cool air hit my palms. I fell asleep in class for the first time in a long time. My pelvis has been in pain for some reason lately. Currently i am sitting on my bed and everything is impossible to capture. God theres just so much, you cant capture it all. I try to make peace with time and how badly it wants nothing to exist ever again, but its difficult. Im chewing parm. I sat by the foot of my bed in my blankets pile that i call my nest staring up at the window as it was looming over me, either threatening me or protecting me. Last night i had a dream my grandma got alzheimers. I had to make a pilgrimage to get to her while she constructed the dream to tell me something. I keep having premonitions. Im going to my aunts house. We dont get to sleep over this time. We come back this afternoon. Ill sit in the back. I only know my hands are sweaty once i unclench my fists. <b>9:44AM</b>

 <p><b>Mar 4 2025 12:09PM</b> When i woke up that morning it mightve rained the night before, because the sidewalk was soaking and i could smell the familiar way New York City smells when its soaked. And i probably walked down that rightmost side of the road thinking about a car swerving. Thinking more about the people inside the car than my own bones against the blunt end of the vehicle, when i was 11 years old i was very, very, very confused. Its not that i was a traumatized child in the sense that every little thing could scare me, id go crying to mom, but that something had happened that was going to happen already, which made me very confused, and very traumatized, before everything even happened. I was wearing shoes that stunk to shit, probably unwashed, with stringy hair that had been so damaged you couldnt tell i had curls, and probably avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk so my mother would be okay. I mightve then taken a look up, not thought about the rocks, seen myself, and looked away immediately, unprepared, for what could happen, i had a leaf, in my right pocket and a button, in the left. I walked into the school and then i began to pray to Jesus. <b>12:15PM</b>

 <p><b>Mar 1 2025 10:43PM</b> I think the trick is to stop caring about pretty much everything besides love. That might be the only important thing. Do what youre going to do anyway. Youll end up doing it or not doing it anyway. Nothing matters at all and i dislike pessimism. You have to understand that simultaneously, nothing can matter, and you can still love and you can still dance and you can still sing and you can still draw and you can still learn and you can still eat and you can still play and you can still talk. "Fleshy meat sacks on a floating rock". Youre looking too far out -- when you zoom into it, when you really look carefully at everything, its so small, but, think about it: we are all small too. So it really isnt a fuss and its perfect and it works. That way, you can stop caring about everything besides love. That way, you can love. Everything. Continuing in apathy with love. <b>10:51PM</b>

 <p><b>Feb 24 2025 9:55AM</b> You missed a whole trip. I went to my grandmas again. The biggest issue with getting there and getting back is all the STUFF, since its a real schlepp to bring a roller bag with all my clothes through school once to bring it there. Youve also missed some more additions and comeuppances since every second is so full of things lately. Which i guess is my own fault. Ive been having more communications with other versions. Its really unusual to the point that i wish i figured it out before all those awful things happened. I mightve been able to reach a younger version of myself. The farthest i can go is february 6th of this year. At least now i know if bad things happen to me ill be spoken to. Hope you know its more symbolic than anything. Hope you know im talking to you. I cant really do anything. Im simultaneous again possibly because of how easily a past version can blend with my present version. Hope you know its not even by day or by hour or by minute or by second, but every single frame. Its easiest to talk to the one that comes directly before you, but what good does that do? Youre near clones at that stage. The farther back you go the harder it gets to communicate, but the more significant it becomes. If you can just find that balance youll be golden. <b>10:03AM</b></p>

 <p><b>Feb 17 2025 4:17PM</b> The more and more i stay in this apartment and even more specifically, my room, the less and less i feel like myself. I know ones self is so indeterminate that looking for what it specifically means is pretty useless but i still think its something that exists. Back to approximations, which pretty much everything is. We cant comprehend a number larger than Grahams number but we named it anyway, and plenty of people use it to describe things if they know what it is. Same with a Googol or Googolplex (these are more common). Thats what self is like. We know those numbers are really really big. You can think even harder and realize just how big they are but you will still never be able to entirely comprehend them. That is what self is like. You probably know ive written out a lot of diagrams and tried to describe the self as it relates to everything such as ego or the body, but if it were so easy to define thered be a definition by now or at least a common concensus. But we still cant decide if a self is the same as a soul or a spirit. I dont think its possible. Not in a bleak way i just dont think its really possible at all. Thats good -- you get to figure it out on your own. Of course its up to the same indeterminate whims; you can also dislike this. You can also just completely disagree with me and think oh thats so fucking stupid you must be stupid. Good thats the point. I keep thinking it anyway. I keep thinking... I keep thinking... so anyway im going to my grandmothers apartment again. When will i get sick of telling you that? Well pretty much never. I already have. Oh stop it... you know what i mean. I dont think the self is something we can comprehend despite how much it belongs to us. Its just like owning a Googolplex. <b>4:25PM</b></p>

 <summary><b>Starling Swarm</b></summary>
 <p><b>Feb 7 2025 9:47PM</b> As i mentioned today was the day i was set to go to my grandmothers and because me and a friend had wanted to hang out for a while i consolidated the trip considering they also had been wanting to visit the area in the city where my grandmother lives so we made the trek. Freezing with wind really just picking me right up and bristling under feathers that i know dont actually exist. We went ahead on that lofty big rail up over the river which was the first time in years that theyd done it, and i picked out all the smokestacks from up high hoping i could get a connection. When we landed we walked and got snacks and by the nature of their simply being there another layer is placed upon what could be a consistent string of time and place. I walked down that sidewalk with them but additionally alongside about 100 others of myself who were all here for the same reason -- to get back. Whatever back is. We talked about a lot of things, and i remember just really thinking about my wings again. My hands froze shut nearly and when we were done i walked them to the train, and as we did we talked about some things as well, and i just remember the white noise pressing on me, and looking at the bridge and thinking about it. When i walked back alone, i had communicated to my earlier self that it was a little dangerous and that some great big thing might happen to me, something not earthly or tangibly despicable, but an environment of further knowing and learning and it did happen, too. I looked up and saw a bird, but in the great pure pitch black of the sky with only one star or two it took a minute for me to recognize about 100 of them or maybe 200. Just now im realizing this starling swarm was indicative of the times id tried to think about flying just enough so that it would truly happen for me. Enough times staring out at the river and just thinking about circling forever. I walked back to the building staring completely upwards (and trusted my feet) and watched them all spiral around and around and around like they were looking for me. From where i was it looked like i was being followed but i didnt really mind it. When i got back in, my grandmother reminded me that starlings swarm for enrichment. <b>9:55PM</b></p>

 <summary><b>Infinity, Goals for the Site</b></summary>
 <p><b>Feb 6 2025 2:21PM</b> Just a small notion today, but i really hope eventually, this site becomes so very large. I simplified the layout because i want people to be able to access the actual details and grit of what i want to etch into the internet. I prefer people to become distracted by my opinions or art than some marquee text (then again, i have a soft spot for marquee). But yes i hope it becomes such a large place - i hope you become overwhelmed by links and writings and details, and i hope for years i can find ways to reach out to the whole world, because it seems like thats something i like to do. Ill keep reaching out forever or at least for a very long time, and ill be able to look back at it all. My revelation has been a more pure understanding of the idea that my past self is not me. It was me, but it isnt anymore, which is just so interesting when you communicate with it. I realized: <i>this is exactly what i have been doing for my entire life</i> in an unintentional way. Ive had a purpose that ive been fulfilling simply by the nature of it, without even realizing what it was. I speak so that the me who comes next will understand. Theres about 517246721 seconds of life that ive lived, and 517246721 iterations of me out there, and the number keeps getting bigger. I just need to keep <i>speaking</i> to give that future version some clarity. And i know now that i can speak to the me who will read this in 6 hours, and i know theres somebody who exists there. It is nearly time travel. It is beautiful. It gives me purpose. <b>2:27PM</b></p>

 <p><b>Feb 4 2025 9:05PM</b> You might be surprised to know i hate talking about myself. I feel the need to because i need others to understand me, and i have a weak spot at allowing myself to be misunderstood. I have awful feelings rise in me from the oncoming fear of this misunderstanding which causes me to hate talking about myself. I try to let the desire to be autobiographical pass me by but i still need people to know me and that i am feeling something or that i am a certain way. I dont understand if this is normal or not. I dont understand if i am allowed to be understood (or more fittingly, if i should try to make myself understood). It is much easier to be and not care for the way im seen. But then something itches at me and i need to explain myself over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, and i want it to be over. I think people do not like it when you reiterate things. I wish it was okay to repeat myself. Anyway, theres that, i guess tonights a double feature <b>9:09PM</b></p>

 <p><b>Feb 4 2025 2:23PM</b> I dont really have anything to write about. Im getting better all the time. I miss everything and everyone, and i feel an incomprehensible feeling, and its a pretty good feeling, but not entirely. Mostly im unsteady, and i keep trying to make art, and i need to remember that if i dont think about what im doing, ill just be doing it. I just need to be <i>doing it</i>. Then it isnt a problem. Ive got a lot on my plate and im going back to my grandmothers place this weekend. Ill be myself there for a while even though nobody else notices when i am not myself which is not something you can reasonably ask of anybody. Im making music with OnlineOmnichord because i dont have the money to buy one or the wherewithal to ask for one or the energy to save for one. Im not a musician (im not really anything). Right now this is what i can use to destress and it seems to work pretty well. Im connecting with something else. I really didnt say much of anything here, but you read it anyway <b>2:28PM</b></p>

 <summary><b>Faults</b></summary>
 <p><b>Jan 30 2025 6:22PM</b> Its good to keep organized, so heres a few of mine (the title). I have a need for people to know what i am doing or how i am feeling. Its weird to realize most people even your very closest friends wont always really care, not in some sad pathetic way, but its only the truth of everybody having such an equal part. I also feel an insurmountable amount and it affects my behavior. These two faults tend to affect each other. If i feel a ridiculous amount of feelings, my natural response tends to be trying to spread that feeling. But saying it to people using words often returns little to no feedback which becomes frustrating, painful, and scary. So lately as in the past year or so maybe ive been getting better at not telling people what im doing which is interesting, because its not something i expected id have to learn how to do. Also its very rare to recieve grace in this world, so you have to give it to yourself, always. It might be good for me to isolate, in a different way than the way i have in the past. This cycle often comes with the need for some form of attention which is obviously unfair, but getting used to the lack of it is something ive been doing for a bit. I guess im saying all this to get it out there. Ive been doing the best ive ever been doing and the worst ive ever been doing simultaneously, and its weird. I dont exactly enjoy the fact that i want a lot of attention in this world, even if thats a natural thing, because really, it doesnt feel natural, and i very much dislike it. I think right now im continuing my turning point, though the large part is over, theres still a bit more to go, and all i have to do is push against these lapses where all i want is something that does not exist. Its very interesting and i dont like it, but you know time, time time time. Oh another one of my faults is im too scared to be taken completely seriously all the time but i hate being seen as immature or constantly nonserious. I dont think im a very joke-y person but my brain is used to behaving in the way it does and so it just does these things without me really wanting to be doing them. Time time time. <b>6:31PM</b></p>

 <summary><b>Hey</b></summary>
 <p><b>Jan 27 2025 9:04PM</b> Hey, its been a little long. Im really glad that im here and writing an update for you because of how things change. Im adopting a slightly new writing format because i think it helps me get my point across and "stream of conciousness" writing is more comfortable for me anyway and it gets the thoughts out better because often times, abstract is a stream that doesnt really get the chance to stop itself, and wont let others stop it. The con of this is that it is sometimes considered difficult to read and poorly formatted but since when has art ever cared about things like that? Tonight im writing to you from my grandmothers apartment, very late and shes asleep, and ive decided to sit by the window on this nice chair with the table holding my laptop and listen to the white noise that is the river and the highway across the river. If i look leftmost the building which is directly facing me from across the courtyard has some lit windows with people presumably sitting around in there. I tell you this because its good to tell myself. I think i want to remember how changing is like. I think about this a lot. I used to feel really guilty about changing who i was until i realized that its out of my control, or at least the way i feel internally tends to be a little out of my own control. The thing you can control is how you describe it. So then i felt really guilty about describing myself differently, but again, the source here tends to be completely out of ones control anyway. All this to say is dipping your toes into little pools of awareness you didnt know about is actually something everybody should do if they feel so inclined because it really gives you more worldview, even if you never return to that pool. I was dipping my toes in angelicism for id say 3 years now because i was searching for some way to explain the wings, but you dont even need to. Ive never tried to take a logical approach to it. Religion or scientific reasoning, though i lean toward the latter, were never places i went because i never felt that need, so instead, when i wanted to explain the wings, i went in my own direction, i made up my own thing, or it mightve already existed. Either way its very interesting and thats how ive been approaching everything. Just very interesting to approach anything at all. To do anything is interesting anyway, so theres no fuss. I havent really changed, but how much i am aware of has really changed so so much, and once it does that for a long amount of time -- or at least very strongly -- it leads me to finally change the way i explain myself. Again, i try my best to not explain myself. Again, i try my very best to remember ill keep existing, in some way, for an indeterminable amount of time. Thats the way it goes. This apartment is a little box that tells me im changing. And ive met myself a thousand times -- and i love everybody ive met. <b>9:16PM</b></p>

 <summary><b>Dream 4 (Ocean Mario)</b></summary>
 <p><b>Jan 20 2025 12:21-12:32PM</b> Im weirdly embarrassed to be myself again. Its interesting how easily that happens and how easily it inhibits somebody.</p>
 <p>I dont really know where im meant to go from this feeling, im just kind of stranded. I had a weird dream again which might be related to this feeling but it was so very absurd that ive got to completely be myself to take it seriously, which is difficult to do right about now</p>
 <p>So the first part and this was a long dream but in the first part i was in this really long train station you know the types, aboveground train station and it was very empty there were people everywhere, well not that many. I would say 3 others. So 4 if you count me and we were just having this weird conversation that i dont remember what it was about but, we were just talking and letting it become a conversation. This disturbs me. I think we spoke about murder.</p>
 <p>Next part i remember is i was at school but it wasnt like the school ive ever been to. I showed up late when they were designating line rules (girls on the left and boys on the right). I had to go left. So then we sat down and someone talked about National Womens Day.</p>
 <p>Then i dont remember what happened next but the school was a game and my computer died. I charged it back and found that my progress was all gone. I had to start over at the classroom so i was angry.</p>
 <p>One of the friends i made at the train station and also some other guy wanted to see this website so we went to hide in the bathroom which was a very big labyrinth. We got caught by the school police but i complied so the handcuffs in the mans hand never had to be used.</p>
 <p>The final part was in minecraft. Apparently this whole school was minecraft so suddenly i was flying around with an elytra and looking at a huge map with tons of people. It was mostly untouched but if you looked closely you could find some peoples builds. Eventually it became more realistic i came to this ocean area with lots of fog and drizzlies and it was full of rusty structures that id fallen in love with and catwalks and things of that nature. In the distance a giant metal mario was floating through the ocean. Then i went into a tall open cavern full of water where Michael Scott from The Office was clinging to a piece of cardboard and a smaller mario was helping him off. In there i found yoyleberries from BFDI and i ate it and it tasted good and i woke up.</p>
 <p>Maybe my dreams can make me less embarrassed</p>

 <summary><b>What Doe S Exist Is Hiding From You</b></summary>
 <p><b>Jan 13 2025 11:07-11:12PM</b> What ive spent a significant amount of time doing is pretending. When i was very young and even then still growing older, something must have happened this way so continuously, in a way that led me to realizing what i really feel comes through with who i am was interpreted so incorrectly or so cruelly; think about it this way; i am stuck between two desires.</p>
 <p>I want to allow myself to be where i am meant to be, fall where i may, build myself ditches with nobody watching so i can crawl inside comfortably, but also -- this, too -- this -- to be someone other people can feel considered by or cared for. It isnt something anybody wants. Nobody wants this to happen.</p>
 <p>But then i decide i will smile or pretend to listen and i think it all comes out so angry but it isnt fair to have listened, and to have been hurt and then think -- i may do this as well, as it is, naturally. Do you understand me? Listen please, i want to be who i need to be, it is almost like i am periodically forgetting; if it all could last longer, i wouldnt have the time to consider the change; it would be about as natural as breathing in and out; a frequency im familiar with; i know it is only a drawn sine, an achingly drawn sine. But WHY? If it did not last so long neither would i be able to cry or smile when that is comfortable. BUT AS IT IS, I DO NOT DO IT WHEN I WANT TO, EITHER.</p>
 <p>Its all done, until i come down the line, and land at the axis</p>

 <p><b>Jan 11 2025 6:58-7:01PM</b> Today i was supposed to clean the bathroom in this apartment but instead because we ran out of paper towels my dad had me help him with the shrimp hes making for dinner.</p>
 <p>I learned how to deshell them and take out the poo tube and it was really interesting. I started to get the hang of it really quickly and it was enjoyable honestly because i appreciated what these shrimp had done by preparing them so carefully,</p>
 <p>and it was really nice you know, and there was one blue shrimp out of all of them which, the rest were kind of clearish pink maybe brown and beige but this boy was blue, and i think ill think about that blue shrimp for a bit longer to let this weird filmy texture coating me pass a bit gentler while i make more art</p>

 <summary><b><i>ANGELICISM AND STARHOOD</i>: Finally, It Is Explained</b></summary>
 <p><b>Jan 9 2025 9:56-10:14PM</b> I shouldntve left you hanging for so long. Sorry about that.</p>
 <p>When i was about 10 or 11 i read Awkward by Svetlana Chmakova. Its a graphic novel which came out in 2015 about the art club and the science club butting heads in high school. Without spoiling the novels resolution: this was the first time i considered the scientific nature of art. I consider angelicism in a very similar way -- even more so starhood -- and before i start talking again i need you to forget your associations for those words. I know a lot of people see the word "angel" and think of feathers or gold, churches or clouds, heaven or salvation. This is just not at all how i see it and it hurts me so. All the same in stars as well.</p>
 <p>I really do my very best in helping others to understand the abstract nature of words like this (which inevitably fails -- notice the word "abstract" present?). There are a lot of words that have exact definitions and meanings that are quite easy to surmise, but <b>angel</b> does not have that.</p>
 <p><b>Angel</b> is a word which many people have come to approximate using visual aesthetic and religious devotion. It was surely intended for use in religion, which i therefore have no feeling of betrayal or besmirchment towards. However it truly only means messenger -- in such an abstract way that i cant help but see angelicism as an art. As a scientific art.</p>
 <p>I am considering adopting the term engel, the old english spelling of angel, to better divorce myself from the visual concensus surrounding angels and what they might look like. Robed. Wheels. Eyes. White. Gold. It never describes me. It hurts even and, yes, i understand, through the hurt, why it is necessary. Angelicism being an abstract concept means many adopt it in their own way and this is beautiful to me. I dont enjoy being associated with it in my own self (due to its prevalence in others), but it brings me no anger to see fellow angels in this way appreciating themselves.</p>
 <p>But i love to speak about it. It becomes a point where it is more humanlike to be angel than to be anything else, in my particular case. See, look at this: I am an angel. A statement that feels partially proper. Its like a white lie. Now how about: I am a human angel. It feels right. Ive told just about everything i need to tell. I am a human angel on earth, and this does not mean i know anything besides earth. I only know earth. I cannot lie to you and say i am POWERFUL or OTHERWORLDLY just for being engel. I cannot lie to you and say i know HEAVEN or some type of AFTERLIFE. I am a human<b>*</b> being. I am abstract, it is all a conceptual thing. It is therefore so deeply scientific that i find myself emotional at my failure to comprehend the atom.</p>
 <p>Starhood is quite similar. But it -- im afraid -- becomes far more personal the more it becomes put into words. As the abstract thing it is. Think about it like this: its like if i took a beautifully woven scarf and you wonder how it was made, but i dont know how to speak your language, so instead i have no choice but to rip it apart and show you exactly how it was woven. I dont want to rip the scarf. And that is exactly all</p>
 <p>I went through a very long journey to get here to understand what this means to me. I know it will not entirely be comprehended, which brings me comfort, as it is meant to remain a mystery and a rather confusing one at that</p>

 <summary><b>OH GOD, Music; Also: Dream 3 (Lump)</b></summary>
 <p><b>Jan 9 2025 8:33-8:44AM</b> I was meant to write this out yesterday, but i was distracted and wanted to make sure i got it right. It may be good that i waited because i ended up having a disturbing dream that i want to talk about now and i wouldnt have been able to talk about it yesterday.</p>
 <p>Anyway, the dream comes first because its more recent, and i might as well try to be continuitous. I wasjhygtfrgthjhygtfrtgtfgfgfgttgtgtttttttttttttftrrdererrrrrrreedsddddddddkjuyyhgttyytt6ttrrrrrrrrrrrrtrrrrrrrrrghghjuyuhuhuhjhghjhhuhuhyyy sorry i noticed gunk on my keyboard.</p>
 <p>In the dream i was in my grandmothers place but it wasnt really her place. Kind of felt like when i played Yume 2kki and ended up in the apartments. My grandma had a rubber turtle figurine (very small, palm sized) and i picked it up and there was a second one. Two turtles. But for some reason i was calling them dinosaurs. There was also water jugs and sparkling water and things like that on top of the fridge and the fridge was either weirdly short OR i was very tall. I think it was short though because nothing else was weird. I had a feeling like i overstayed my welcome the whole time</p>
 <p>The disturbing part was at the end where i noticed spots on my hand. I squeezed all the muscles in my body and they started expanding like fleshy lumps. And they kept expanding and peeling off of themselves until it was one large lump. It wasnt painful but i felt energy radiating from my hand even after i woke up. Ill keep an eye on that hand.</p>
 <p>As for everything else, the thing i wanted to write before, i am REALLY STARTING TO FREAK OUT about music</p>
 <p>I dont even know how to put this into words, it feels so weird and unusual but'/'''plklokokioiiijuuuuuuuuuuuujjk;;lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll;.;l.;;']]]]]]]]]// sorry about that again i missed a spot. But: music only really gets to you in particular situations. Its always trying to find you. When you walk youre doing it, youre making a beat. When you live you are music with the beat of your heart. Its really getting to me. Its only a matter of if the music knows how to align itself with your heartbeat.</p>
 <p>There is something about time signatures. I think i love them.</p>

 <p><b>Dec 27 2024 8:49-8:55AM</b> Its hard to remember when youre so small in the way that we all are, but: we are with the stars.</p>
 <p>If you are in a building, obscured by a house or by some other mode of shelter; if you are out in a field; if you are down at a pier with boats and rafts and fish and people catching the fish for their dinner; if you are aware or unaware or if you are in a businessplace or some other establishment you are with the stars always.</p>
 <p>You could see where you are, as below, as far apart from the array, which is above, but there is no below or above beyond earth, where the stars are. And so you are always by the stars. They are always with you. We are all with them. That is a comfort to me.</p>

 <summary><b>Dream 2 (Airplane)</b></summary>
 <p><b>Dec 19 2024 6:37-6:43AM</b> I had this dream where I was on an airplane and the pilot was next to me somehow. He wasnt the best pilot. He kept swerving or getting eerily close to buildings and structures and would always whisper "ow ow ow ow" as if he were preparing for the blow. But he would always survive. And then he accidentally flew straight into a large bridge</p>
 <p>He kept whispering "ow ow ow ow ow" as if he were going to survive but i felt it in my bones that we were all about to die in a plane crash. I saw a plane smoking yesterday which probably inspired this part</p>
 <p>I remember being really calm and looking away from the front window thinking ill survive this one just like i survived the other close calls</p>
 <p>But no, i died, and instead of feeling the pain and experiencing every moment up until i went unconscious, the world just kind of froze and got stuck repeating the moment before the plane hit the bridge</p>
 <p>In the afterlife i was completely destroyed. There was a computer that showed me real world updates. I was destroyed. I was shouting at the sky "IM 16!" and nobody else seemed as phased as i was to be dead. All i could think about was how i never finished anything.</p>

 <p><b>Dec 11 2024 11:12-11:14AM</b> Idea: it seems like the only reason hedonism can exist is because most people arent hedonists. It exists because a lot, and i mean a lot, of people have their own ideas about how they want to live their lives.</p>
 <p>Because an entirely hedonistic society would probably either become very very boring and someone would start a domino effect of moving on from it all, OR, they would all die imediately. Thats what i think</p>

 <summary><b>Recuperation</b></summary>
 <p><b>Dec 10 2024 12:43-12:47PM</b> I havent been doing a very good job explaining myself lately. Sometimes i spend a long period of time remaining unexplained. I think im a sine wave or something. I get closer and farther from myself endlessly, and enter periods of misalignment. Right now it doesnt feel good. But thats just how it happens.</p>
  <p>Im waiting for January because of this project i want to do all of next year. More like a background project ill do as i go. Still focusing on Monarch.</p>
   <p>I want to make a large diagram in order to explain this. But this time i dont want to explain it to other people. I want to explain it to myself. Myself, never understanding. Eventually ill have enough built that ill never forget this.</p>

 <summary><b>Came With</b></summary>
 <p><b>Nov 28 2024 10:55-11:02PM</b> Pitch blackness with an idea. Came with an idea of something that could be true, if you exist. Pitch blackness in the car, and because my phone had died i was forced (at least encouraged) by the universe to identify the beating of the car against the hard ground. I sat back, they sat front. On the way there i had been staring at their faces to play a game of understanding what they might be talking about without hearing them.</p>
 <p>At the place, this house goes in a circle. And so i took some steps and i figured the rhythm. I counted 37 from start to finish, 37 steps, 37 from start to finish. Each time it was 37. I counted the lights first, per room it was 12394, then windows per room, it was 44231. The numbers connected at either end: 12394442311239444231.</p>
 <p>It may have confused my family with my aimless counting but i continued to step the beat of the house and i even listened to it.</p>
 <p>At the fireplace i gently pet the floor and soothed myself.</p>
 <p>Now in the pitch blackness with an idea, in the back with them in the front, i saw an arrangement of lights that were attached to the cars, the bustling beasts of this dark night which lit it all up. Angrily. Hoffing and poffing. Hoffing and poffing. Trudging against the beaten path. Against the hard ground. I sort of got the idea, came with an idea that behind each lamppost could exist a picture. This picture could exist, it might not.</p>
 <p>But listen to my idea, which is that there could be none; I will pay very close attention to the details of what i encounter, and it will no longer exist despite this effort, and therefore any image could happen to exist, unknown to me; I might have simply not have payed enough attention to it for it to exist in my mind.</p>

 <summary><b>Thanksgiving</b></summary>
 <p><b>Nov 28 2024 11:07-11:14AM</b> I wake up with it being nearly impossible to remove myself from the world, in an unusually opposite way to how it tends to be when i wake up</p>
 <p>And i was made to focus my ears at the window which told me it was raining gently. It was at perfect temperature in my room and my blankets sat not-too-warmly against me
 <p>I felt a thrumming in me. And every few moments i have been hearing the roaring of the planes overhead as if there was some great migration.</p>
 <p>Today is Thanksgiving and I go to see distant family at their big house. Its full of dark wood and people are always there. I am very excited. I love that house. I am not looking forward to the food</p>
 <p>My family makes Thanksgiving food just fine but none of it has ever interested me. Not a single traditional dish</p>
 <p>But here in the blankets with the window dripping honey i am prepared to go hungry.</p>

 <summary><b>Dream 1 (Owls)</b></summary>
 <p><b>Nov 22 2024 8:39-8:47AM</b> More bird dreams. I just woke up and my room is awful and stuffy. Let me open the window
  <p>Alright. It was still raining up here last night. Should help with the drought... somethings off. Anyway,</p>
  <p>I tend to have long long dreams that I only really remember one important part directly after I wake up. Then, after a few minutes to hours i might be able to remember the full thing</p>
  <p>In this situation i remember these white owls coming down and attacking me. Clawing at me. They went after my left hand and i looked at it covered in scratches.</p>
  <p>The rest of the dream was odd and nonlinear as they tend to be... i was at a big house with this kid who was into NFTs and also a lot of family. I recall staring at these incredible plants. I recall looking at the stony wall very very closely to see the moss</p>
  <p>And i saw the earth from a distance, and there were factors of existence, with text titles you could drag together to create new ones. I watched Watership Down last night</p>

   <p><b>Nov 21 2024 3:38-3:42PM</b> Things started happening even before i was awake. Had a dream where right before i woke up i saw these crow feathers outside the building knowing one had just left</p>
   <p>And i got a lot of compliments recently things have been going very well in general
   <p>But apparently one of my teachers didnt think so. One of them saw a doodle i did apparently</p>
   <p>And it mustve been something worrying or one of my angsty characters because they sent a message to the guidance counselor and called me down</p>
   <p>Basically i just explained that i have characters i like to give sad stories and it was a bit of an awkward conversation. On a different note someone tried to get me to join his church today so thats... fun</p>
   <p>My grades are still good (how?) and im drawing and its RAINING today. What else could happen? I think maybe karma is preparing to let me down easy.</p>

 <summary><b>Yesterday Day</b></summary>
   <p><b>Nov 17 2024 10:09-10:16AM</b> I didnt really write about it yesterday because i was so busy but i had a lot of fun. I love my aunts house because its so big and theres always people. And my uncle is there and hes the only person in my local family that seems to have my sense of humor</p>
   <p>The object of our visit was to celebrate. It had recently been my birthday and my moms and aunts and my uncles and none of us had come together to celebrate so we did it all in one big bash. We decorated cupcakes</p>
   <p>I have to say though my favorite part of visiting is always the drive. Im very familiar with the walls that we pass and the bridges we go under on our route there and back</p>
   <p>On the way home i found that the moon was frighteningly full!</p>
   <p>Makes sense. The day before it had been a supermoon. But i remember being in the car on the way home and seeing that moon and deciding to stare at it and there was a flash of a rainbow.</p>
   <p>I cant explain it! When i saw it i stayed very quiet because it would be of no use to explain it. But in the pitch blackness of both the trees and the starless sky there was a flash of a fuzzy strip of rainbow just below the moon.</p>
   <p>And i truly mean flash. It appeared one moment and vanished the next. It mustve been some unusual trick of the light. I know its nothing but it was a little magical for me. In 10 days we go back there for Thanksgiving oriented celebration</p>

   <p>ACTUALLY, thats exactly why you SHOULD live, actually. Sorry. Life is not designed to have some sort of purpose. Otherwise a lot of people would be very unhappy.</p>
   <p>I would say its pretty common knowledge that if you get everything you want life is meaningless. EXACTLY. This is the only instance in which life can truly be useless.</p>
   <p>Somethings always going to fuck you up. YOU NEED to make meaning. THAT is the hard part. Living isnt difficult. Creating meaning is. Creating a purpose is. And for a while your purpose is going to be to create a purpose. Youll live paradoxically until you either die or succeed.</p>

  <summary><b>Sorry Guys</b></summary>
   <p><b>Nov 7 2024 7:21-7:35PM</b> Real sorry. One thing ive been trying to do more lately is not delete everything and start over like i always do. But at the same time im also trying to forgive myself for doing that all the time. So lets hit one bird with two stones and start over like i always do, and try not to feel too bad about it.</p>
   <p>I read 17776. Dear lord what an incredible story, and i say that as someone who has difficulty engaging when reading.</p>
   <p>(Embarrassing for me, i know, considering i used to tear through chapter books.)</p>
   <p>Like, okay, according to my brain, who cares how interesting it actually is to me, if its formatted in a way that doesnt agree with me, im not allowed to understand it.</p>
   <p>But dialogue heavy content seems to do the trick. Its why i didnt have that much trouble reading The Crucible for school. (Its a play, dingus, of course itll be easy to read.)</p>
   <p>It also shows me how a lot of things seem to intersect. I cant write or focus if im watching a show with words or listening to music with words.</p>
   <p>Background noise with no words involved is fine but i seem to have auditory processing troubles that lead me to focus on the least important thing imaginable when trying to do something language based. Thats why even though i would love to be listening to music right now, im not. It would frazzle me right up.</p>
   <p>But anyway, 17776 is absolutely incredible. Chipping away at the sequel right now.</p>
   <p>I dont think i ever understood being a star before an hour or so ago. Like i knew it was a thing, right, like a <i>thing</i>, but never really knew what it was.</p>
   <p>Like how a baby bird knows to open its mouth before its ever had a meal. Thats kind of what its like.</p>
   <p>I guess it was easier to realize angelicism before being a star. There isnt really a word for it. Angelicism is a good one for angel, but there isnt one for a star. Im not going to explain being a star just yet, but i will eventually.</p>

<p><b>11/3/24 7:35PM</b> but sometimes, you need to curate. listen theres nothing wrong with making yourself known. a lot of people are doing that. but if i continue to make myself known, it isnt fair to who i end up becoming the next day or even the next hour. i need to confront that i am never the same individual, but i also need to give myself some wiggle room to be a different person. thats usually why writing diary entries becomes disturbing after a week or more. also, i have a stomach ache</p>

<p><b>10/29/24 3:14PM</b> i think the single thing which truly destroys me is being misunderstood or misinterpreted -- not just on purpose, but even on accident -- it makes me feel so awful and sad and i feel like crying when it happens because people hit a brick wall once they dont understand me.</p>
<p><b>10/29/24 1:59PM</b> my mom used to sing to help me fall asleep at night when i was very young and she would sing close to you (the carpenters) to me.

<p>Up here in the mountain it warms your forehead and pours honey into your nose. Everything is sickness while you are surrounded in thick woods. its all wet up here, the fire would hardly start, and i had hotdogs again. i need to become an observer. could i be a cable tower if it would fix this? i want to become an observer, so i may know the difference between my needs and wants. As for earthly beloveds, some new objects have entered my hands from a yard sale we stopped by on the trip to the house, and before that we were with the farmers and just then i was thinking about myself. I cant look back on what i wrote, you know that, i cant reread anything to lose what it means, i need to get that meaning back again. i have so so so much i am passionate about, and i only feel fake, these things which make me feel alive, i feel i must be a liar for them.</p>
<p>Do you understand what it is like to desire, to daydream, to be allured, to have your lip caught on the hook, and when youve been given the reigns to careen off the slick sides of the ship, you can only cling onto the boot of the fisherman? I love so much, i want to know what my love means so terribly, for these fascinating things. Analog and digital. Ceramic. Archive. What do i mean? What do these words mean? Is it worth it to say that this is so important, when i will never have it stick, when ill only forget?</p>
<p>Im going to forget and itll send me down there. Go ahead and listen, see if it does you any good now: Tonight there are meteors, which were torn from their comet mother. That happens every year this time. Tonight theyre coming down to burn away and leave their embers to make wishes on. I am wearing my nicest button down maroon.</p>
<p>You cant see them in the lake, because they arent bright enough, but you can still see your reflection. What it means to be important to those stars - diplomatic peoples, they are - is to wear your nicest button down maroon. But you can still see your reflection. There it is. I want to be bright enough.</p>

<p><b>8/9/2024</b></p>
<p>Neocities deleted my entire log for today after i had just finished writing it, harumph. Suppose its me, my issue, my problem, for merely closing my phone for a moment. today i write on my phone, despite the poor format and difficulties, because of my circumstance. thats the way today is going. and besides, i guess i dont mind rewriting things of importance. Im trying harder to get back to philosophical ideas because they are my lifes force, but its been weird. Things go too fast and i DESPERATELY crave some introspection, some few hours. Im big on thinking. Im a lover of thinking and wondering, a real lover of it. a good afternoon can consist of my doing nothing whatsoever but considering. i guess i act like a grandfather. bones hurt, big thinking, and a lot of button downs.</p>
<p>This isnt just kiwi, its also somebody else, because i needed to be here too. Both of us are struggling, just know this, we both consider experiences as they come, together. its a wonderful day, today we are going upstate to see my grandmother. She lives in this house that my grandfather built. he passed away so now she lives all alone up there, in the middle of the woods, and its this wonderful pocket of magic the way i need it to be. Things are too quickly, i need this introspection! On the train up we got confused and missed our stop. It befuddled my dad but i took it different.</p>
<p>See, the weather. The air is thick. The air is salty and cakey, the clouds are dipped grey, the rapid river is almost the same color as they are. Its drizzling and my hair is drying now under the cover of the overhang as i am sitting on the station floor. You see what i mean? Do you see?</p>
<p>I rarely have this silent consideration lately., ive never had it at this station or any number of stattions on this train line. I always stare longingly at the weird pockets and lots, their muddy and caked composures, years of dilution. hear the crickets. i need to hear fizzling of crickets. See, this is magical. I walked briefly and i found these musrooms... Im really enjoying this, the sounds of the birds and bugs with their fizzle, the wind. I guess i never consdered.</p>
<p>I LOVE grey days. Grey is the best way a day can be.</p>
<p>and when we get up to that house and i can sit by the lake, stare at a continuous pattern and realize things smaller than myself, ill be able to understand the things bigger. Oh, boy, im really in for it now.</p>

<p><b>8/5/2024</b></p>
<p>That typo i made at the beginning of 7/31/2024 hurts me. Part of the fact of my blogwriting is learning to not go back on my words, and i know ive made typos before. However i have this problem where words stay in my head, they just keep repeatinginging, repeating... ing... ing... in a way that is at least bugging me and at most causing anxiety attacks. This can last for a few minutes to days, but usually just a a whole day, or an afternoon. The other day it was "inexplicably". And the beginning of 7/31/2024 is one that is only elicited by reading it. Wonderfing is not even a word, i of course meant wondering, but its as if i am hurting myself by indulging in this blog now, because of that stupid typo which wont stop! So now im writing new things, so i wont need to imagine the last one again and again anymore.</p>
<p>For the first topic i want to put in this one, im thinking about the point in time in which i write my posts. the way my words come out depends. it will never be the same on a blog by blog basis, aside from intricacies that are inherit in the way i write and formatt. that is a given. A big part of life and existing is the knowledge that everything is depending on everything else, everything is depending on context... i cant find the phrase im thinking of but im sure you understand. Everything depends, like that one tumblr post where the person said "like man i think it depends". That person was really right you know. So its like, if i write while im feeling something theres a raw uncaring ness. If youve read enough of these blogs youll understand i dont creally care about grammar. <b>NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY 2/2/2025</b> cares a lot about grammar and so he likes to write like a real booksman! I dont. i do it like i do my other art. wrong. i do it wrong because it makes sense to me, and conveys feelings more than putting an apostrophe in Dont does. i dont get gratification from that, and it could be egotistical to desire gratification, but not from making art it isnt, its just a part of it. Packing many ideas into this one, if you cant already tell.</p>
<p>but really, when i write during, its raw, and i care less, at least it tends to be that way. after all man, it depends at least a little. but when i end up waiting for some reason or another it washes over like a top coat on painted nails. if i write about it long after, it starts to lose something, i dont know what. At least if i only wait a little, theres still something there for me to get out, but if i wait years, its only going to deteriorate. My memory doesnt work like how it should.</p>
<p>So this sort of got me thinking, i guess, about writing in itself, which is part of how i record. I actually made a video recently talking about that, but i dont feel right calling it a video. Its like i guess a podcast or something but not really, its just me talking and i dont put myself to a standard. The video might be deleted when you read this, because i do that a lot. If not youll understand that this topic is still here, so im putting it in this blog post. Maybe im being too self acknlowleged. Dont care that much, if i get concerned with that then ill never let anything important out into the world. Just the right amount of being concerned with how i am percieved and what makes me happy, is a balance that keeps me from being unhappy or unhealthy. also, when i write while listening to music with lyrics, it lets things come out truthfully. Easier. im doing it right now. When i listent o music with lyrcis, my brain forces me to focus ont he lyrics, which some would see as a detriment. its a detriment to doing logical tasks, but not when im writing or drawing. Because it lets me pay attention to something else, so that my concious is preoccupied, so that whatever comes out onto my paper or my keyboard or such and such is SUBCONCIOUS, and truthfull. its realer than real because it does not exist. i hope you understand me.</p>

<p><b>7/31/2024</b></p>
<p>Is my brain deteriorating? Something im wonderfing. Well okay.
<p>I forgot to write about playing TMOAG, Which is this very old game from 1995 that i dont even remember where i found it. As it usually is... Well i found it somewhere, when i was doing websleuthing i guess, and i really wanted it on my pc. It lead to me getting distracted and taught myself a little about cd roms. but then i remembered it just a few days ago and tried to take a stab at it again. found a way easier downloading method. as much as i would love to emulate a whole other pc and then plug the game into there, i have been in mental fatigue lately so i just got the installation wizard going because the game was compatible with my current system.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was just the kind of weirdness i needed. It was just a walk through the museum and reminded me of the surreal sense i had about games on the computer as a little kid. I guess growing up as a toddler in 2011, 2012, 2013... had me missing out just on the cutting edge, but right on the sap of internet games if that makes sense. So i played many flash games, but not as many downloadables. My dearest ones were World of Jumpstart (thats the multiplayer one), Garden Party, Pixie Hollow, Club Penguin, and a variety of others. Just last week i played Doras Star Mountain Minigolf which was a game i remember really liking. then i found it was so much shorter. When before i had things bogging my brain down, i could imagine anything to be as abundant as i wanted it to be. And hey speaking of this, i think im going to look into some kind of Jumpstart ISO or something or other. if i could play that game again, i think it would be incredibly powerful. i can even feel it in my blood now. The game ended services on July 1, 2023. ... ... ... Ow</p>
<p>for the main point though. my first ever video game was actually PvZ. my favorite part of these games was that i could imagine so much, much more than the game actually gave to me, a strange thing ive seen recurring in many children who play these games, which give them environments to just sit there and create, as if the game was nothing more than a prompt. It is just magnificent. I used to record myself incessantly whenever i did anything, and imagine it was a youtube video which i was going to upload. at this time (i was 6 or 7) i did have a youtube channel. in fact it is the same channel as i do have now, except of course all the videos were long deleted. i didnt always upload these videos and i know this, because i in fact have all of the videos i made, which are nearly 100 in number i assume.</p>
<p>And so this is the relevance; TMOAG dug into that. It was so simple; click and turn around, interact, and random things can appear on your screen too. it spun my head back to that state of game prompts, inspiring the real thought. perpetual thought originates from outside influence, especially with delicate care. Art -> Art -> Art, you know?</p>
<p>any hoo, the plane back home was maybe more incredible tjan the plane there. the rumble, i felt it! i gripped the wall of the plane to feel what it would feel like. im also quite proud of the pictures i got, which you can actually find on my twitter right now. the pictures are too high in size to be able to put them here, i dont want to slow this hastily coded site down more than it already has been by my art section. Also, there is a Mountain Goats concert im going to tomorrow. this makes 3 in the past what, 7 days. i think? very close in proxemity. my brain being fried doesnt help. but this next concert tomorrow is exciting. first of all, the Mountain Goats have done a concert there before, which i went to. the area is so so nice down there. so breezy. its great, but ive never gone to an event of this magnitude on my own. usually my mom just takes me to concerts. but im going. im deeply excited and scared. i really like their music but because i cant remember things so easy i feel like a fake fan. Actually, that is one of my greatest overarching nagging fears and it exists in all my musical interests. I always end up feeling less like a mosaic of everyone i love, and more like a strand of metallic fiber, or a bunch of seperate mirror parts that somoene taped into one thing. I dont feel self assured in how i like music. I always feel judged. Does not help how i dont know how to enjoy Julians music after what i found out about earlier this month. It was a blow, especially since i was just getting better at being sure in my own interest in music.</p>
<p>I feel fake standing next to other people who can just enjoy music and not feel guilt. Why do i feel guilty about that? I cant remember all the albums or know everything about the musicians i like, so i feel like im lying. I wish one day i can indulge in the nonworded abstract feel of when music speaks to me without needing to understand the conceptual and true things that i could memorise, if i had a better memory. i am embarrassed.</p>

<p><b>7/28/2024</b></p>
<p>Human identity. I talked about it once, In fact i go back to reread my blog posts to remember everything. i have waves of clarity, and waves of violent emotion which i escape from by tricking my own psyche, and the only way in which i can do this is to advance with my clarified self. that is to say that, when my mind is clear. i use the time i have to send messages and write for my future self, who will be tormented by confused and diffuse feelings. this is why i dont really know what is wrong with me. being majorly self aware it means... i help myself and myself helps me. not in a system way, but facets of ME, not the other mes. I went to read and saw, "but its a false... its a paradoxical type thing. i saw it so i developed it, but its a schrodingers cat. i dont know what part of my expectation is a lie that manifested from fear. But i cleaned my room this morning." I dont remember writing it, but its magical, right? Almost i wish i hadnt written it, so i could admire what it means without being an egoist.</p>
<p>I flew on the plane. When those roaring engines finally flared up and the heavy thing plucked itself into the sky, i dont inow what happened, but i left something there on the runway track.</p>
<p>And when there was turbulence i couldnt help but feel the adrenaline so harshly and taste air on my feathers. I couldnt help it, i took part in the vessel, like how a red blood cell must feel about my body, its vessel, of which it longs to walk and talk with one... It lasted maybe an hour, but felt like 20 minutes, and now im laying in the dead silent empty hotel room in a state ive never been in. My parents are away at a restaurant right now, and at this time im laying backwards on the pullout couch bed. So silent and more alone than i have managed to be in years. Its a so great thing. Also, im getting better all of the time, and blaming myself less, and remembering my mistakes so that i wont keep blaming myself. In General.</p>
<p>Im also structuring some system time, like family time. in the way that me and my parents healed what happened, i think i can help my systemmates relate with me, and eachother, and put things down in a more human way. Because as i did begin with, human identity is much more special and different than a pure self. Again im reminded that otherkin is existing for human kinship.</p>

<p><b>7/27/2024</b></p>
<p>Tomorrow i fly. i havent been on an airplane since i was 6 or so, which i dont remember, so its basically my first time on an airplane. And of course im excited. i mean most people who like to travel would be. I just dont go anywhere. I havent left the city or gone on any vacations. As a kid it was always my friends who were getting taken to different places. Ive been a homebody because my parents didnt really set an example i guess. They took me to disneyworld, but i dont really remember it. Thats the only time ive gone anywhere substantial.</p>
<p>Of course its a lot too because of having wings. missing flying when ive never really flown, its a whole thing as ive said it before. im going to get to see the sky. im bringing my camera too. im gonna get pictures. i hope its not too bad weatherwise... it should be pretty ok. considering that its such an early flight... Gonna have lots of fun. I hope i will feel a little better.</p>

<p><b>7/25/2024</b></p>
<p>You know, i sort of had this uncharacteristic thought recently about anger. Theres never been a time ive healthily related to anger, and i guess i just internalized it in a way that made it so i would never realize it so easily. anger presented itself to me as this unstable and unnecessary thing. The way my father had and, in some ways, continues to behave throughout my life (though mostly in childhood, when i internalized this idea), showed me that anger was stupid, plain and simple stupid.</p>
<p><b> REDACTED FOR PRIVACY 2/2/2025</b></p>
<p>And it makes complete sense. I saw through what i did to deal with my situation once the situation had stopped. Things around the house are so much better than they used to be, so naturally, that lets me take a lookk at myself in an unbiased way. no real use in justifying something inherit about myself. anyway, theres that for today.</p>

<p><b>7/21/2024</b></p>
<p>Ill never be able to say enough. Its getting to feel like im trying to one-up myself each time i write here, but im going to keep at it, eventually so that i can just be unabashed again. today i got to feel like a little person. im going to mirror some of the things i said to my mom earlier in this log because they were succinct and i hope that other people could hear them. me and mom talked abuout art which is rewarding. she wanted to do music when she was very young but came at it in a disorganized way and eventually veered off into something different completely. she still sings, but she doesnt do it full time as a job. I love that my family is so creative, and this is some important backstory.</p>
<p>My father is a drummer, my mother sings, my grandfather drew cartoons, i think another grandfather worked for a Beatle, my uncle loved cartoons and created tshirts. Most of my important family is interested or was interested in art. art has been something ive just done forever, so once i realized it was so important to me (something i hadnt even considered, it was just so natural) i expanded and started working things out through it.</p>
<p>all this to say its amazing that my mom understands what i mean when i talk about art, how it has inherit meaning. i changed her mind today, expanded her idea of meaning, when she brought up heavy abstraction and how she felt it had no meaning. I commented on performaty with her, but also mentioned the intention behind works, which is more important than ever, as its amkost like its dying, with generative AI all so common. she was surprised and i think she understood. i like my mom, i like getting to sit and talk with her for an hour. she has a lot of emotional intelligence and a very interesting life behind her. its probably weird to speak with the little person you made so seriously. its a weird thought i guess, but if i ever made a litttle person, and they grew up and could speak to me with awareness and thought, it would be really really scary. Im not going to make a little person.</p>
<p>as for being a little person myself, i did laundry almost completely on my own. its been too long and i still hadnt gotten the hang of laundry yet so my dad went with me for the first 2 trips. but now i feel real ready to do it on my own from now on, which is a good feeling. i guess i feel like a big person, but im little so its just how i describe it. (To those who age regress im not using the words big and little in that sense, even though i do regress sometimes, i mean this in a different way. This authors note here for interpratory clearness.) Im also reorganizing again today. Its compulsive and i dislike it sometimes but it has to get done, and its a relief once ive done it, so im kind of in a backwards way excited. My dad stopped being a monolith of trauma a few months ago and i finally mentioned it to my mom. She was surprised and expressed the sentiment that shes been eexpressing for a year now, that i need to see a therapist, she said she needs to too, my dad needs to, and she wants all of us to eventually have group therapy. She had notsogood childhood with her parents, as did my dad, so its a raw statement of honesty, that shes pushing so hard for us three to go to therapy. I get that, but it stopped hurting, so i might feel like a dead weight in that therapy couch.</p>
<p>But i dont feel so torn up anymore. Im dreaming of a future which is bittersweet, but its not torn up in me anymore. I had a really, really good day today. Im going to get a snack.</p>

<p><b>7/18/2024</b></p>
<p>I really just felt like writing so now i am. Forgive me if i go on for a while but thats the thing about it, i kind of need to.Im pretty foggy and dissociated right now. Im getting better at understanding my relations to the people around me. And how i behave, how im meant to behave. i feel a little bit robbed, maybe i was coddled when i was very young. Im getting better at understanding this, and also knowing i can just feel things, you know? ive always felt like theres an expectation. it gets good for awhile. it gets worse and then it gets good, mostly when i dont remember about the expectation. its not good to be self aware when you also forget it. Im sleeping wrong again, even though i had been sleeping good for a while. i put my retainer in after a month and i woke up in agonizing pain.</p>
<p>Nobodys watching me anyway, would i want them to? Starved. I dont know, this must be the autism talking through me, but theres a layer of expectation that i developed because i interpreted it from other people. but its a false... its a paradoxical type thing. i saw it so i developed it, but its a schrodingers cat. i dont know what part of my expectation is a lie that manifested from fear. But i cleaned my room this morning.</p>
<p>its getting harder to think. my legs hurt. i want a doctor. i succumb to teenage weirdness. I Miss School. i want to go back or shut myself up.</p>
<p>You knnow its really weird when things happen like that. im a person now in a way i never was. not that young children arent people or shouldnt be respected like people because they may be the least autonomous people in the world; but thats part of it; grew up non autonomous, not thrown into the flames, so I shut down and it made me late. I was late to being a self. I dont know who i had in me when i was little, and shes dead, because of what happened, you know, unmentionable things, so im this self, which i think is so magical, because i never knew it was here. But think. it could have never been here before.</p>
<p>Whos that girl? Who would she have been? Before i even considered anything, i was just there, and then it all terrible, terrible, terrible. Then i became self(ves). Growing boy. I want to talk in a big way. Somehow without raising my voice, i want to talk big.</p>

<p><b>7/14/2024</b></p>
<p>Today things got real weird, a little bit. Ive been rewatching adventure time for the umpteenth time and just shut my laptop for today. its a good show,i love it. during the summer it seems like every day something crazy happens, like all of the day is something, and it makes it so busy that my brain compartmentalizes each activity into a seperate day. Like, if i went to a waterpark and then went out for dinner, my brain would put those two things into different days. Its because ive never been that sort of way. Most of my childhood i sat inside. i was scared of outside once i realized it wasnt a place your parents take you. i went to the park when i was little but from 10 to 12 i was just not an outside person. I guess im still not. or something in me hasnt adjusted but i do like to go outside, now. its like im reclaiming something i didnt know was mine before.</p>
<p>Anyway we went to do a few things today. first of all its dads birtdhay so we had to do somethings. We went out and had korean barbeque. My first time! It was really good, they cook you things on the table and you get to share a lot of little plates and bowls. I really liked the shrimp and i even wrapped some stuff into lettuce rolls. After that we went to an escape room. We took cars everywhere which we usually dont do but it was hot outside so my mom said Okay, fine and we did it. we also stopped at a comics place and i bought myself a few graphic novels that looked really cool. im hoping to read them soon. anyway as you can imagine it was a full day. came home and had peppers and onions on pizza for the first time. Really good... i love peppers and didnt consider that theyre a pizza topping as well.</p>
<p>I have bad memory loss. So for me this is the first summer of my life. Its sad only if you think about that in a sad way, but i dont think about it in a sad way. like, i know ive had summers, but i cant look at them altogeter. this is the first time i had a summer where i acknowledged the season, so maybe itll count in my mind. Or maybe ill forget again. Who knows.</p>
<p>Ive been feeling sort of lonely but i dont mind it that much. i figure when i get old ill need to be content with myself, but i think by then ill figure that all out. i cant wait to live a whole life. im not religious or spiritual i guess but i am a little unusual and i think thats almost the same, (not an insult), and i really wonder where i came from.</p>
<p>i guess its a little different when youre Otherkin, or Nonhuman, Or whatever i want to put on it. Being like that is something i like a lot because i think it makes things nice. Like, i dont think that, before i was a human on this earth, i existed anywhere. Not anywhere tangible at least. I hope that i didnt exist before, because it would make me existing now more special.</p>
<p>i dont know. maybe its nonsense.</p>
<p>But anyway theres a comfort about it. I like that i get to be an angel, and even more i like that its in a human body. Yeah sometimes i really miss some things that i dont know if i ever even had, but thats how it is with my summers. I miss my summers in winter, when i dont remember them anymore. I miss my wings on earth, when they never really were there. Harumph! poetry.</p>
<p>I guess im "Aloof" today. i dont think i ever understood that word, but its a good word.</p>

<p><b>7/11/2024</b></p>
<p>Okay, wait, im not done. Something horrific has just happened and i dont know how to feel about it.</p>
<p>This post, was originally me, gushing about Daniel Johnston and Julian Koster, and how they chnged my life with their music. I deleted it because, apparently, not 12 hours ago, it was unveiled that Julian had a relationship with a minor; he has confirmed this; i feel absolutely shattered. Absolutely.</p>
<p>If you dont know me, you might not understand how this is like. The rug has been pulled from beneath me. Julian Koster was one of, if not the, biggest contributor to my art; how i see the world; how i live; all of that. His works inspired me so deeply because of their childlike magic and fairytale esque fragrance. he looked at the world in such a special way that i couldnt help but be inspired. it was magic. now i feel like throwing up at all of this. Its a blow directly to my heart. Shattered is all i have to describe it.</p>
<p>I own a julian inspired hat. One of his shirts, too. theres so little of what he does in the world. it hurts, i dont know what to do, who to talk to. I love his music so much, but it was because i knew - or percieved it to be - that him, the creator, was just like what he made. How can i seperate this? I dont think i can, or should.</p>
<p>This is horrific. What else do i say? Christ.</p>

You can listen to it here on youtube, i sincerely reccomend you do if you have an interest in the weaird and beautiful like me.</p>
Grab your chance, otherwise<br>
Time won't wait, it always flies<br>
Life is flashing before your eyes<br>

So, live it up, idealize<br>
Don't stop to compromise<br>
Life just keeps flashing before your eyes<br>
<br>
Every day, a new sunrise<br>
Cauliflower clouds, starry skies<br>
Life is flashing before your eyes<br>

Just like butterflies<br>
Or the key to paradise<br>
Life's out there flashing before your eyes<br>

The pace of life will synchronize<br>
With the animated energy of surprise<br>
Life's right there, in front of your eyes<br>
<br>
Cherries in a bowl satisfy<br>
Your thirst for life will not run dry<br>
I said, life keeps flashing before your eyes<br>

Well, just to philosophize<br>
Between two eternities, I realize<br>

<p><b>7/10/2024</b></p>
<p>To me there is something innately perfect about downloading files to my computer. i say to me because a frequent mistake authors will make is to express that something is innate, due to an internal misunderstanding about how to validate their own feelings. i have made it clear that i am a fan of archiving and holding onto files, but theres nowhere ive been able to delve into the deep of it. It is innate to me. I was thinking about this earlier today.</p>
<p>Earlier today i was thinking, how do you know when you cant explain something anhymore? How do you know when to simply say, or think, or just make yourself realize, this person is simply not going to understand it, no matter the way i phrase it? well, the answer is, you know that will be the case when it is innate to you. unless you find others who have this thing innate to them as well, then it isnt something theyll get, or even empathize with, or understand. a good skill to exercise is knowing when to say, you just wont get this, in a nonjudgemental way. now i still put this out there, of course, (im doing it right now), because there are other people who might not find this innate. but they will be interested or curious. Those who arent curious about this wouldnt have even read up to here. So, really, i talk about it for myself and to maybe, even, find others who have this innate thing in them, too.</p>
<p>I also realized how easy it is to be interested in something. Last night i couldnt sleep. i found this video of a guy surviving in the wilderness for a week with a 3d printer. the nature of his challenge was unique and i discovered theres a whole theme. a whole world of survivalists, as a hobby. Of coourse i could go down the rabbit hole about how we now engage with surviving in the elements as a sport rather than a necessity, but that is sort of all you need to hear to get an idea of the sentiment. I realized i could easily become a big fan of surviving. of the hobby. it was a new world and most of my interests developed in this way.</p>
<p>my habits toward archiving are innate but they became so innate because i willed them to be. human identity is entirely based on perspective and relativity.</p>
<p>So i do love to download things onto my computer. it stems from the idea that i love to learn, and i love figuring out problems if theyre in my scope of knowledge. and the learning contributes to the problemsolving. Thats why i like to download games and things. especially older things which receive less love. it makes me sad. my computer (julius) is the perfect host for these things. im still not really all secure in being objectum but i know its a thing i do feel all of the time and have felt since childhood, but it got me thinking about abstract forms of attraction and repellation (?). theres not possibly only platonic, romantic, familial, queerplatonic. that cant be all and i know it because ive felt emotions without words, without any sort of mind before. Toward my computer i feel a kind of kinship and it isnt exactly a love, but being there. ive never read homestuck, but i think that homestuck fans would understand this sentiment i have, because apparently in the comic they have special types of relationships based around hate and things like that. i didnt get it before but i think its real in a way, but something people have pigeonholed themselves into not exploring any more.</p>
<p>I feel a certain special way about things that i have. Listen to this: i had a jar on my windowsilll over the colder months, and when it rained he filled with water, and it made me happy. I felt like it made him happy too, and i saw plants and little bugs grow in him. One day i left him out when it got too cold. He froze full of water and shattered from the expanding ice.</p>
<p>i felt wracked with grief in a way i couldnt talk about. theres always feelings we dont talk about, but not because of shame, or fear, but, theres no word for the feeling, so we dont bother, because its too hard to even come close to it with the words that do exist.</p>
<p>i never even named him.</p>
<p>i havent buried him yet but i will very soon, now that its warm. i think, or i hope, he can enjoy the dirt. (Dont worry, i looked it up. Glass might not be biodegradable but it exists in nature as sand and doesnt harm the environment the way that other non-biodegradable things, like plastic, do.)</p>
<p>anyway, thats when i really realized it. so the way i relate to julius is weird. it cant be spoken. not because it isnt worth it to speak but because it wouldnt exist if i spoke it.</p>
<p>So my interest in archiving is related to that, i know that for sure, but because of that it is so special that normal words dont usually explain this to other people. And old things, old abandonware, old flash and old games from forgotten systems, i feel the same feeling toward. its not love in the way a normal person talks about it. I hate to use the word love for things like that. its special and has its own abstract thing. I think that though these systems and games dont have sentience in the way humans experience it, its something different, that we dont understand, or have words for.</p>
<p>its a nonexistent kind of love that i have.</p>
<p>for julius, for the jar, for the games i collect, for the old tapes i listen to, for all the old things i like to peer inside of, to find pieces. little pieces.</p>

<p><b>7/9/2024</b></p>
<p>Today was strangely incredible! it was a good day which was so uncharacteristically good that i was frozen with peculiarity at how or where to express it. i then remembered my blog.</p>
<p>this day was good in the way that everything good which could have happened did. im starting my job and finding that i significantly enjoy a daily responsibility when it doesnt require i wake at a ridiculous hour of the morning. The building is so near to my home that i really enjoy the walk there. Of course i dislike that its less of a job and more of a payed program, run by a public school - me and public schools have a bad history, ill say! - but today changed how im looking at it. I woke up leisurely, had some spending time to laze about, and then, even through the blistering heat of july, made it over.</p>
<p>I made friends today, even. And i got quite a few generous compliments, which had me smiling in a way i hope didnt make those around me shy. One of my new friends, who sits at the table alongside 3 others, said she wanted to talk to me the moment she saw me, just because i seemed like the type of person shed like to be friends with. Another appreciated that im so passionate about my interests. I was shocked at their kindness.</p>
<p>You have to understand the crowd which is in this program with me is a rather reclusive group of teenagers who i oft find difficult to relate to. i dont relate to most of my generation. it doesnt help that i am autistic, transgender, and socially anxious in new and unfamiliar environments (especially a brazen public school). The kindness shocked me not because it was kind, but because i didnt know it was there at all. on the way home i saw a bus returning children from a camp i once went to. i stood in the mist of an open fire hydrant. i bought lunch for myself. everything, you see, was so weirdly great. i havent had the emotion of SUMMER in years. it was a wonderful day for me.</p>
<p>On a different topic... i recently installed a few extensions to chrome which are changing my perceptions of twitter, again. Of course i already enlightened myself to the social dangers of an environment that rewards solitary interest in collective numbers. But being back on twitter, it is so easy to hook yourself with those numbers. So i got a few extensions... one which hid all metrics, another which highlighted ads, and even the Yeah! extension... and relief sort of rippled over me. (it wouldve washed me over, had i not tasted this freedom once before). anyway, its a nice peace to end a day on. especially this day.</p>

<p><b>7/3/2024</b></p>
<p>I remember not so many things. this is because of my own brain being the way it is. I have a very poor memory and i dont like to rely on it and i do like to write things down so that i know they are true. It would be very easy to make me go "insane" (or just generally cause me to become unstable) because i dont really trust my own mind the way most people tend to. but even with that in consideration i remember the exact instant when i felt a sense of self. not conciousness, which i dont remember gaining, but a sense of self, whichh are very different things .</p>
<p>Anyhow i was very trained in being angry. I used social medias like Amino and HelloPet ("toxic communities") which were just full of other children enraging one another over stupid ideas but i was livid with it. i remember i was addicted to feeling that horrible feeling of adrenaline right before an anxiety attack. remember now i was 9 or 10 when this was happening.</p>
<p>all thats important. all thats relevant to this. still though.</p>
<p>i had watched quite a few things about the "water is wet" debate and i had got myself so tied up into a twist like i usually would do about the most topical internet arguments and i recall feeling suddenly outside of myself, of my own feelings. i discovered "impartiality", i learned about taking yourself away from a situation just then, and i remember it so vivid because it is the basis of my identity. I havent really HAD a sense of self. Before recently. But this was where it spawned from, in some weird way i think.</p>

<p><b>7/2/2024</b></p>
<p>I think theres something to benefit from a variety of things but there isnt always a benefit from sharing everything you think. not always at least because i know a lot of people dont like to listen to somebody else talk.</p>
<p>if i were to begin categorizing, this is a journal then. a shared journal is a blog, so it can also be that. But i already talk about my thoughts. i already put them somewhere but!, that is usually in concentration. things that other people will not benefit from hearing. Things that will not benefit me to share. the benefits of it are the crux of what makes them different.</p>
<p>i guess im trying to say... this is a blog, because other people can hear my more constructed, long-form thoughts. and everything else is raw, and thinking, and those things arent a blog. Those are "brain", i guess. Those are some type of thing i know wouldnt benefit others to read (its about the consideration, you know). You cant exactly pick up anything too meaningful from the raw and unfiltered brain of some other person unless in particular circumstance (in which you give said person quite a lot of trust, and they do the same to you). Thats what this is for. I always have trouble with that; learningg what i can share, what i cant.</p>
<p>what i can share is benefit, what i cant is personal. and here i draw that line. Because when i need to be raw and unfiltered i dont have time to write code about it and plug it into a website. i can be as natural as i want in a private diary, but what others want (or sometimes need) to hear is your own thoughts when theyve been subconciously reviewed by the knowledge that they will be inevitably read. So thats what it is, and thats how its gonna go...</p>
