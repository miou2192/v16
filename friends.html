<p><b>block / why did you block me if I didn’t do anything (ik you have no idea who I am) (mar 24 2025 9:26PM)</b> - you do not have to do something "substantial" to make somebody uncomfortable and as you said, i have no idea who you are, so otherwise, i dont know what you want to hear. its more likely ive forgotten why i even did it in the first place. i trust my past choices. good living (mar 24 2025 9:35PM)</p>

<p><b>---!!!@@@ (h-n.ncts.rg) / your site is my favorite one ive seen in a while-too many sites all look the same!i value uniqueness and genuineness and personal expression a lot@good job (mar 19 2025 6:02PM)</b> - thank you very much, your site makes me feel the exact same way, it is such itself, it is such itself. i cant exactly explain the relief i feel sorting through it all but i can certainly make it known. (mar 19 2025 7:10PM)</p>

<p><b> gwah... / is there a reason you keep changing the layout of your site often? well- not often, just enough that every time i come back to neocities it looks different. not a bad thing by the way! just out of pure curiosity. i really like your stuff though, i'd have to take a look at your site again now that it's changed. -miri (mar 17 2025 9:11PM)</b> - imagine if every time you came home to your apartment all the furniture was moved very slightly, like 1 inch at a time, so eventually it becomes unbearable, so you try to put it back to where it was supposed to be. the furniture is the same furniture, most of the time, just in a different location, and i can never get my couch to stay exactly where i want it to. thank you for asking. (mar 18 2025 2:06PM)</p>

<p><b> idk where im at / heloo (mar 16 2025 6:23PM)</b> - only you can know (mar 17 2025 11:59AM)</p>

<p><b> Rr / Vg (mar 16 2025 4:27PM)</b> - glad youre having fun, typing letters (mar 17 2025 11:57AM)</p>

<p><b> something / ok ill ask a different question,,uuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh do you like uhhh do you like playing and drawing cuz i do (mar 8 2025 8:09PM)</b> - yes, but its difficult to get people to play whilst they draw (mar 10 2025 10:16AM)</p>

<p><b> something / what do you think of egg sandwich (mar 7 2025 4:43PM)</b> - im almost ashamed to say that i dont like eggs very much and subsequently most sandwiches in most situations, therefore egg sandwiches are out of the question (mar 7 2025 5:24PM)</p>

<p><b> resonated / I really resonated with your latest journal entry. I completely agree, pessimism is so boring, love will always be the way. LOVE POWERS EVERYTHING. love ur site.
best, Margot (diaryofalady) (mar 3 2025 7:37AM)</b> - im very glad. its agreed then. thank you (mar 3 2025 2:55PM)</p>

<p><b>hihihi / I've been in and out of your site for a while, but today I realised that I never actually followed you on neocities so I followed you and I just wanted to drop by and say some things hehe! Your art and coding are honestly sosososo awesome and I find you to be so inspiring so genuenly tysm for posting here on the web!! I've only recently started this whole coding and art thing (inspired by you), so my stuff is really super basic but I'd love to be moots! virtual hugs from <a href="https://riotgrrl.neocities.org/">https://riotgrrl.neocities.org/</a> :DD (feb 10 2025 3:34PM)</b> - thank you for your words! your site is nice and homey, i cant wait to see you make it your own. (feb 12 2025 10:54PM)</p>

<p><b>I speak so that the me who comes next will understand. / I read this and it began to echo endlessly in my head. What a beautiful idea. I think I will be circling it for a good while. (feb 6 2025 8:36PM)</b> - im very happy its reached you in this way, as it has reached me (feb 6 2025 9:29PM)</p>

<p><b>lala / hi ! i really enjoy looking at your artworks as they give me inspiration to try out more mixed media stuff :-) also we're moots on twt ^_^ (jan 30 2025 1:53AM)</b> - hello! thank you! im glad! keep making things; you shouldnt just take it from me (feb 2 2025 1:47PM)</p>

<p><b>Hello from a rabbit in outer space / Hi kiwi! I know we don't talk often but i just wanted to say that I really admire your art and website and you've been a huge inspiration for me. I wish you the best of luck for you your animation career!! (BTW, if you're interested in coding, you should join <a href="https://hackclub.com">https://hackclub.com</a> !) -With thanks, <a href="https://bunnyguy.foo/">https://bunnyguy.foo/</a> (jan 22 2025 10:25PM)</b> - hello bunnyguy! it was so nice to see you in my asks. thank you very much for your kind words im honored to have inspired. your programming and code and such inspires me as well very much, so look at us and our equilibrium. (jan 27 2025 11:12PM)</p>

<p><b>Just a message / Thank you for posting your art online. Looking at bluesky and seeing ur creations there once in a while fills me with so much hope. 2024 was a terrible year for me so I barely created any art at all, I want this year to be different because of artists like you. Thank you so much for that. ((Im a moot, wish I had the balls to interact more, I reeally love ur logs, specially that recent one abt angelicism,it rlly resonates with me !! not necessarily bcuz i have exact same feelings/opinions abt the topic but i just adore to see this dissection and reflection by someone else who's different then me but also deeply cares abt it. I also want to go back to my personal website and make my own little "diary" as well n stuff)) (jan 11 2025 6:02PM)</b> - goodness! -- your words were so true and from your heart that it shocked me. im so very glad my art inspires this feeling in you. it isnt often i feel like i can communicate properly which is why it is much more special when art does that for me. feel free to interact with me more. im looking for everybody. (jan 11 2025 6:48PM)</p>

<p><b>How long have you been coding? / I'm always interested in learning how, why and when different people picked up coding, and also how they ended up on neocities! Do you have anything on that? Love the site! -sami (jan 9 2025 11:28AM)</b> - i love a good excuse to ramble about code. technically my first experience with code was in middle school when we had a computer class and had to play those javascript code games to get the character to collect all the coins. path type stuff. that was my first interaction with it which i guess made me like it.<br>
i decided to own my own personal website after growing very frustrated with jumping from carrd (website builder) to rentry (text site builder) to txti (same thing) without feeling like any of them really gave me the freedom i wanted. but its become something much different for me fundamentally since becoming interested in it. learning to code feels like learning to communicate with somebody and its gotten easier over time just like a friendship does. its sort of like the code is helping me get across what is typically very difficult to get across, like a medium. ive only been really /coding/ coding and practicing html and css for /real/ since i owned this site which is august 17th, 2023, according to neocities<br> 
im glad you like the site, thank you for stopping by (jan 9 2025 11:47AM)</p>

<p><b>bale of hay / whats cookin good lookin (jan 9 2025 10:48AM)</b> - in 6 hours pasta will be cooking! (jan 9 2025 10:55AM)</p>
